<p class='paragraphHeader'>Miguel Angel Zotto</p>
<p>While Alejandra and I have commercial videos of most of the
well-known tango performers (and we&#39;ve also seen a lot of them in
person) we&#39;ve never had a great interest in watching tango performances.
Usually in milongas if there is a performance, we just wait for it to
end, so we can dance.
While most of the milongueros and milongueras will tolerate some
demonstrations and performances at milongas, and applaud politely for
stars and young beginners as well, many of them also become impatient
after a few minutes, and want to get back to the milonga.
The organizers realize this, and in the best milongas, demonstrations
of tango are rare -- and usually short.</p>

<p>I had seen a few videos of Miguel Angel Zotto, and also seen him a
couple of times in the milongas, but it never left a great impression.
Although I had always heard what a great dancer he was, I had never
actually seen it.
Then last year on Argentine TV they showed a tribute to Virulazo.
It was filmed about 15 years ago, and featured performances by the
best stage dancers of that period in Buenos Aires.
I thought they were entertaining, but I also felt that I could see
milongueros every day in the milongas who dance with more emotion and
creativity.
But then Miguel Angel Zotto and Milena Plebs came on.
I remember watching for a moment, jumping up, calling to Alejandra,
running around the room trying to find a blank video tape to put in
the recorder, and trying to study what they were doing, all at the
same time.
I never did get the thing recorded, but I can still picture how
spectacular they were.
They were heads and shoulders above everyone else, and I realized
why they had such a great reputation.
It was clear that they were the best.</p>

</div>
<p>So it came as quite a surprise when our friend Julie Taylor called
last January and said that Miguel Zotto wanted to meet us.
It turns out he had heard about our interest in capturing the
milongueros on film, and wanted to discuss tango with us.
I was a bit skeptical at first, thinking that maybe stage superstars
might not be especially fun to hang out with -- but he turned out to
be a great guy.
We had dinner, and then lunch after that, and then he invited us to
his house so he could make an <em>asado</em> (Argentine barbeque) for us.
It turns out Miguel is a very serious student of tango, and he has a
great sense of humor as well.
He loves the strange characters that inhabit the milongas, and he can
talk about them forever.
Our discussions with him were far ranging and fun.
They covered everything from picking up women in the clubs, to
organizing shows and the history of tango in the barrios.
He was full of energy, and he didn’t hesitate to jump up in the
crowded restaurant to demonstrate a movement, or illustrate something
from a story.
Unfortunately I didn’t record any of it on film or audio tape (next
time I will!), but here is a brief summary of what we covered.
It’s the best I can do with my limited memory and limited
understanding of <em>castellano</em> (You’d think that after living on the
Mexican border for 30 years, and practically living in Buenos Aires
for the last 5 that I would be more fluent in Spanish -- but I
still struggle with the damn language).</p>

<p>First, Miguel said that he thought our filming was important.
He said he did the same thing to learn tango, and he loved the
small digital camera I had.
He laughed about his early filming with a huge camera that he had to
lug around, and hold on his shoulder to film.
He talked about the development of tango, and the great <em>patrons</em>
in each barrio that set the style of the tango for their neighborhoods.
I won’t list them all here, but it was fascinating.
I had seen some of them in the documentary film <em>Tango, Baile Nuestro</em>,
<em>Tango Bar</em>,</p>

<p>He says he worked as a bricklayer with his father and brother when he
was young, and that they would actually practice and dance tango
together at the construction sites!
(Talk about a culture gap -- a bunch of rough construction workers
dancing tango together among the cement trucks and scaffolding of a
construction site is almost beyond the ability of the non-Argentine
mind to comprehend.)
He talked about the first time he met the legendary Antonio Todaro
(his main tango mentor).
He said he was walking down the street in <em>Flores</em>,
<em>Urquiza</em> style, from the <em>Villa Urquiza</em> barrio.
This is the style of people like Julio Duplaa (Zotto admires his
dancing), and <em>El Chino</em>.</p>

<p>Tango is a surprisingly small world, and I remember Miguel’s brother
Osvaldo in the first tango workshop I ever went to (in Santa Fe, New
Mexico).
I was struggling and discouraged.
I was tied up in knots, and he kept taking extra class time to take
me aside and work on my posture.
Where else but tango can you find someone at the top that will take
the time to work with a hopeless beginner?
The first time I ever saw Miguel Angel was on my first trip to
Buenos Aires.
I had been at the milonga upstairs at <em>Club Español</em>,
<em>Avenida Corrientes</em> and <em>Nueve de Julio</em>
that simply had a picture of him about 25 feet high and just the
word “Zotto” displayed on them.
I thought, wow, here is maybe the most famous guy in Buenos Aires,
and he comes over to pay respects to a milonguero from
<em>Bernal</em> who takes the bus and doesn’t have 2 <em>pesos</em> in his pocket
to rub together.</p>

<p>The respect between Miguel Angel Zotto and the people of the milongas
is mutual.
Unlike many other stage performers (who they usually ignore), they
love and respect him.
He told me the thing he is most proud of is his commitment to
maintaining tango traditions on the stage, and of his ability to
keep the respect of the milongueros.
He says he tries to minimize choreography, and that he always leads
his partner when dancing on the stage.
This ability to keep a foot in both worlds (stage and milonga) is
very difficult, and Miguel may be the only one who can link the two.</p>

<p>At this point, I’d like to digress a little, and discuss creativity
and the process of learning tango.
I just read an interesting article in the New Yorker about the jazz
saxophone player Sonny Rollins.
It’s called “<em>The Colossus</em>” (by Stanley Crouch), and it talks about
why Rollins may be the greatest of all time.
In the article, Rollins talks about how he absorbed the rich life of
the clubs, and how it became part of his playing.
Rollins mentions the violence and the “frailty of peace and calm…
the ambience of slow close dancing and whispered courtship” of the clubs.
But more important, he says, was  “ear training”.
He intently studied all the great tenor players of the golden period,
and he was somehow able to retain it all.
Unlike the other saxophone players, Rollins accessed everything that
had happened to the tenor saxophone at a young age.
“He was not just approaching the surface of the sound and technique,
but the emotional depth and breadth.
What was most shocking about it is that all of these other musicians
were older.
But Rollins sounded more mature than any of the others.”
The article continues: “Out of Rollins attentiveness to his forebears
had come a heightened sensitivity to melody, harmony, rhythm, and timbre.
The shading that gives a note its emotional texture.”
It goes on to describe a sort of “schizophrenia -- or multiphrenia,
perhaps” -- the ability to carry several artistic personalities
inside, and call on them at different times to create something new.
The article says this is beyond the ability of most concert musicians,
because they are reading music, or playing from memory, and are too
constrained by training to go further.
“This makes it veritably impossible for him even to encounter, much
less master the kind of personal hearing knowledge from within his
own being that Rollins has.”</p>

<p>It’s amazing how much this article about a jazz saxophone player
relates to tango.
Miguel Angel has avoided the constraints of the stage dancer by
intently studying the great milongueros  of the past, and,
essentially, accessing the emotional life of the barrio when he is
on the stage.
Even at my own humble level, I know exactly what they mean when they
talk about Rollins having the artistic personalities of the other
sax players inside of him.
I have filmed and watched so many milongueros  that they seem to be
floating around inside my brain.
A sort of whirling circus from all the barrios of the city --
and with the right music, in the right ambience of the milonga,
they are released.
The emotion is mine, but without them, I could never express it.</p>

<p>The last time we met, I asked Miguel Zotto if he felt that tango was
being hurt by people giving classes who have little understanding
about the basic techniques or traditions -- and I was impressed
with his answer.
He said, yes, there are a lot of people teaching the wrong things,
and yes, there were people trying to change and invent new things
without understanding tango in the first place -- but he didn’t
think that it was a big problem.
He told an interesting story.
He recalled a panel discussion about art or dance or something like that.
It had professors and artists, and it also included the tango singer
Goyeneche.
Although he is very famous, Goyeneche sat quietly while the panel
discussed the need for art to grow, and how tango was stale, and
needed to change.
The conversation was being dominated by academics, and especially by
one young woman who was a well known performer in Argentina.
Finally she asked Goyeneche what he thought.
He said, well, what they said was true -- tango always needed to grow.
But then he asked the woman how old she was.
She said “I’m 25 years old”.
He said gently, “Well, if you stay in tango and come to me when you
are 40 or 50, we may have a different discussion.”
Miguel said the program continued, and the remark was sort of
passed over… but it is the one thing he remembers.
He said despite the bad teaching and bad dancing, he’s not worried.
Most of those who stay, the serious ones who stick around for 15 or
20 years, will eventually find tango.
Some never do, and others move on, but in time, enough of them will
get there -- and the great tradition will continue.</p>
