Tango in a Small Space
</p>
<p>Like it or not, stop-and-go tango is a reality in BsAs, and we have
tried to show how the tools needed to survive these conditions have
formed tango.
But you still need to express the music.
What do you do when the floor is packed, and the DJ decides to play a
tanda of fast milongas?</p>
<div align='center'>
<img alt='Raul Poi at El Beso' class='picborder' height='320' src='2_pics/16tightspace/image001.jpg' width='193'>

<br>
<br>
</div>
<p>Not only are Raul Poli and Pocho very well known and respected
milongueros, but people in the clubs say that both also played a part
in the popularization of “<em>traspie</em>”, the quick tripping-step that is
now a part of milonga style tango dancing.
Dancing milonga the right way means stepping in the cadence without
pausing or skipping beats (pauses are part of tango and <em>vals</em>,
<em>Canning</em> when there are two people standing on every
<em>baldosa</em> (floor tile)?
(Well, okay, <em>Canning</em> doesn’t have floor tiles, it has wood --
but you know what I mean).</p>
<div align='center'>
<img alt='Rosa y Pocho' class='picborder' height='180' src='2_pics/16tightspace/image002.jpg' width='400'>
<br>
<span class='pictureCaption'>Rosa and Pocho</span>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>The solution evolved through talented and innovative dancers like
Pocho and Raul.
They began to find steps between the quick cadences of the milonga music.
Now, instead of using up a lot of floor by walking every beat of a
milonga, they express the music by dividing the rhythm into very
quick, tripping syncopations.
They essentially squeeze more dancing into a smaller area --
sometimes stepping quickly with no forward movement at all.
Watch the brilliantly quick <em>traspie</em> of <em>El Gallego</em>
and his brother Dany, or the flowing milonga of Raul Poli.
Or, possibly the most senior and respected milonga dancer of all, Pocho.
They may pack more creative musical expression into less space than
anyone in the world.</p>

<p>The point is that while the crowded conditions of the clubs  sometimes
put limits on the what dancers can do, they don&#39;t really hinder
musical expression.
In fact, they open the doors for new ways of dancing, and they make
tango what it is.
Without the need to express tango in a tight space, <em>traspie</em>
would not exist.
The elegant first step that the great dancers use to resume their
movement along the line of dance would never have been born.
The compact and incredibly complex <em>giros</em> around a single axis
of milongueros like Ariel, Gerard Gellé, or Tito would probably
not exist.
(Tito used to be famous for doing so many giros that the women would
get dizzy.
When he would try to make Alej dizzy, they would just end up laughing,
but once in Canning a woman actually fell down, and he had to be more
careful after that).</p>

Ariel and Tito often link 5 or 10 giros in one direction…and then reverse directions and do 5 or 10 more.
<br>
Top row: Ariel is stepping backwards, turning counter clockwise. He then stops, and begins to move clockwise.
<br>
Ariel did about 10 quick giros around a single axis, reversing direction halfway through. (<em>Salon Canning</em>)

Gerard Gellé dances with tremendous energy.
He uses every inch of the floor, right up to the tables --
and almost under them (last picture).
Gerard is with Alejandra* (top row), and with Noemí Yódice (bottom row).
</p>
<p>You might notice that in the first  picture where Alej is dancing
with Gerard (one row up, first on the left), she has her head turned
so that she is looking right, with her left cheek to her partner.
This is unusual for Alej, but Gerard asked her to try it.
This position creates more dramatic photos, and allows the camera to
see the faces of both dancers, so social dancers sometimes use it
when performing.
They also switch back and forth, depending on their dance partner’s
preference.
Generally, Alej finds this position uncomfortable, and prefers the
more common right cheek to right cheek embrace she is using in the
rest of the pictures.
Right-to-right generally makes it easier to keep the head centered
and relaxed in close embrace.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: This image  of  Raul Poli (top of page) was taken from a
video that was shot when he was very sick.
After I finished filming he sat down exhausted, and couldn’t dance
any more.
The next day he went into the hospital, and he is still recovering at
this time (5 weeks later).
He put everything he had into it so our video would turn out well,
and I’m very grateful.
It was a brave effort, and the dancing was fantastic.</p>
