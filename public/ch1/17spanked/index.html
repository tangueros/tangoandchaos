“<em>Traccion a Sangre</em>”—The Andes !
</p>
<p>
When I began to train for bike racing 25 years ago I started keeping
a training diary, and although there's no longer any real reason to
do it, I  still keep a daily record of my physical activity.
Here's the  the entry for Oct. 22, 2003:
<em>"Mend</em>
<em>oza centro &gt; base Andes—3.1 med +</em>”
<em>traccion a sangre</em>. “
<em>Traccion a sangre</em>”
<em>Manoblanca</em>
in chapter 4]. I guess you could say I am also traveling by
<em>traccion a sangre</em>
as I stand up out of the saddle and begin to climb into the foothills, feeling the first bite of lactic acid in my legs and the crisp thin air. The mountains ahead began to get bigger, and bigger, and… BIGGER. <em>Holy schnikies</em>- they are HUGE! 
</p>
<p>If Buenos Aires is the big league of tango, then the Andes are the
big league of mountains! 
Once I am out of town, the highway rises through the arid foothills,
following a valley on the left with a river running through it. 
The water has the milky look of glacial runoff, and it seems to come
from a cut in the almost solid wall of the brown front range ahead. 
These foothills are formidable in their own right, rising steeply
several thousand feet above the valley in a wall, broken only by the
cut far ahead where the river pours out, and where the highway curves
around to the right and disappears. 
But it is the towering mountains behind the foothills that are so
ominous. 
A huge rock range, covered with snow and glaciers, and wisps of
clouds streaming to the north off of the peaks. 
They are over 20,000 feet! 
It is beautiful and awe inspiring (and also a bit frightening, if
you are going to try to ride over them into Chile in a few days). 
I wonder if one of them is Aconcagua, the highest mountain in all
of North and South America . 
I suspect not, because on the very poor tourist map I got at the
hotel it looks like it must be farther north, around the curve to
the right where the river and the highway disappear. 
It is probably hiding behind the front range, which is now very close.</p>

<p>Alejandra and I have been down here in BsAs for a week, and we’ve
just arrived in Mendoza . 
BsAs was great as usual. 
We continued with our clean lung strategy in the milongas by dancing
early and often, and then leaving when the smoke began to build to
intolerable levels. 
It worked great. 
The DJs often play the music we request for the first hour or so,
and there is lots of room to play around. 
Lucia and Oscar, the organizers at <em>Celia’s</em> on Thursdays, say
they are always glad to see us because we get things started. 
We are on the floor with a lot of energy early, and we get other
people up to dance. 
You wouldn’t think these old milongueros would be too shy to get up
early, but it seems to be the case. 
Everyone is usually sitting around, and as soon as we get up to
dance, everyone joins us. 
They seem almost like a bunch of high school kids at school dance,
waiting for the first couple to take the floor. 
Or maybe they just can’t stand to watch a <em>gringo</em> dancing tango,
so their only remedy is to get up and dance themselves.</p>

<p>We arrived at one of the milongas very early in the afternoon a
couple of days ago, and Alejandra went into the bathroom and found
one of the well-known milongueras changing into her tango clothes. 
The woman complained: “They keep starting this stupid thing later
and later. 
My husband thinks I’m at the market, and I only have an hour and a
half to change, dance, and then get back into my shopping clothes
and go home. 
They need to be on time.” 
Ahh, and you thought you were addicted to tango.
I just hope her husband doesn’t subscribe to <em>National Geographic</em>
(see the December 2003 issue), or she’s busted, because her picture
is in the magazine. </p>

<p><a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0312/index.html">National Geographic 2003-Dec</a></p>

<p>One of my favorite tangos is <em>Mala Suerte</em> (Canaro),
where a man sings about his bad luck. 
He is completely in love with a woman, but he must lose her
because he can’t give up his addiction to the milongas. 
He says it is because “I was born a skull, and a skull I will die”. 
The term “skull” is Argentine slang for a person addicted to the
nightlife. 
Maybe a bit too graphic for <em>Norte Americano</em> ears, but nice.</p>
<p class='paragraphHeader'>Heavy Traffic</p>
<p><em>Mendoza, Argentina. Entry for day 2</em>: “<em>Mendoza centro &gt; base Andes. 3.1 hard</em>”
</p>
<p>Almost the same ride, with almost the same diary entry, except the
“hard” means a faster ride.
I covered  more distance over the same time period, and on this ride
I got into the steep walled river canyon, and all the way to the end
of the pavement… but wait... the pavement shouldn’t end! 
Apparently I am on the wrong road. 
I had assumed I was on <em>Ruta 7</em>, <em>Pato</em>.  It&#39;s <em>Mataderos</em>
on the city streets
(<em>Mataderos</em> is a western suburb of BsAs where the cattle were
brought into the city from <em>la pampas</em>, and one of the birthplaces
of tango). </p>

<p>They spread a narrow path of sand in the middle of the street for
about four blocks, and then hold the competition. 
There are parked cars, children playing, and housewives sweeping
sidewalks -- while the horses explode down the middle of the
urban street at full gallop. 
When they hit the end of the sand path after their run, the
riders stand in the stirrups, and try to slow down. 
It is incredible to see. 
The horses are going all out on the sprinkling of sand, and then
suddenly they are swerving and clattering on the bare pavement
with sparks flying from their hooves. 
Sometimes the horses rear ends sort of drop, and they skid at
forty miles an hour with the riders casually standing in the
stirrups while taxis and cars turn onto the course just a short
distance ahead. 
There are no police or barricades blocking the course. 
Just a relic of wild <em>gaucho</em> insanity, living out its last gasp on
the now busy streets of BsAs. </p>

<p>A young woman whose husband was riding told us to stay back. 
She said the week before a horse had gone out of control, come over
some parked cars, up onto the sidewalk, and injured several people. 
Where are all the lawyers?</p>

<p>Alejandra is worried about me riding a bicycle around in the Argentine
traffic. 
I’ve ridden before in Latin America, but each time I go out she acts
like I am a lamb going to the slaughter. 
I’ve ridden around in Rome, and a lot in Mexico, which are both
pretty bad, but I think the Argentines take fast urban driving to
a new level. 
The roads are rough and narrow, the traffic is  heavy, and the
traffic signals are sometimes very hard to see:
small, dim, and often hidden by trees. 
Miss one and ride through a red light on a bike and it could be all over. 
Even worse are the unmarked intersections where traffic seems to
dart through according to a system I haven’t quite figured out…
and no one ever wears a seatbelt! 
Even Alejandra’s son, who is physician who has worked in emergency
rooms doesn’t wear one. 
No wonder these people don’t seem concerned about a little second
hand smoke. 
In BsAs I sometimes close my eyes when my bus or taxi flies through
these blind intersections without even slowing. 
At night they sometimes flash their lights or honk, but they often
miss other cars by inches. 
Marked traffic lanes are almost universally ignored, but there seem
to be unwritten rules of the road that make the system work. 
Just like navigation in the crowded milongas, it takes awhile to
get up to speed. 
It’s funny, but once you get into the rhythm of it, darting and
jostling among the cars, trucks and buses on a bicycle can be fun…
in a life-threatening sort of way. 
You bank and swerve on the bike as the drivers cut across multiple
lanes of traffic for left or right turns, squeeze in and out of gaps
with only centimeters to spare, and constantly brake and accelerate
to avoid crashing into each other. 
In the U.S. where everyone stands indignantly on their “rights”
the result would be an atmosphere of constant road rage…
but in Argentina no one seems to get very upset. 
I think the Argentines are a bit more worldly. 
They’ve seen more, and they understand that the world is an
inherently unfair and uncertain place. 
So might as well take it easy and cut your brothers some slack …
while still going like hell.</p>

<p>So after a week in BsAs we are now in Mendoza, which is a pretty
city in the center of Argentina’s wine country. 
It has shady streets and wide sidewalks where they put out
tables in front of the cafes so the residents can come to sit
outside in the evenings after siesta (afternoon naps are
unknown in frantic Buenos Aires, but they are common in the provinces).
There are parks everywhere with families strolling and playing
late into the night. 
The surrounding countryside is hilly and arid, but snow melt from
the nearby Andes provides plenty of water for the vineyards and
the large trees that line the streets. 
Like some of the old parts of Salt Lake City, the streets have
small water filled irrigation canals running next to them, even
in the downtown areas. 
The canals bring the snow melt from the mountains to the trees
and gardens of the city. </p>

<p>The riding has been okay in Mendoza, but we are 0 for 3 on the
milongas. 
Twice we’ve gone to parks where outdoor milongas were scheduled,
and found them deserted. 
Alejandra called a lady, and she said they start very late,
but we arrived at midnight both times and found no one. 
We also started to walk to an indoor milonga last night, but
it was scheduled to begin at midnight, and after a late dinner
Alejandra and I were so tired (she from running, me from riding)
that we couldn’t find the energy to go.</p>

<p>On the west side of Mendoza is a huge park. 
Alejandra runs the 2.5k circuit around a lake there, and on
Day 3 I took some time to explore it on the bike. 
I found a zoo (which we later went to, and it was great), a
huge sports complex with a world cup sized soccer stadium, and,
to my surprise, a world-class
= succeed &quot;.\u{a0}Velodromes&quot; do
  %em velodromo
%em Señor
Chival who was the head of the bicycle federation in Mendoza. 
We tried to call him for two days, but could never reach him. 
Alejandra did find run into some other people from a bike club,
however, and they said no one is ever allowed on the <em>velodromo</em>
in Mendoza unless they are national team level riders. 
Which of course raises an interesting question. 
You can’t become a national team level track rider unless you
practice on the track every day -- but you can’t practice on the
track unless you are at national team level. 
I guess they need to form another federation to study the problem.</p>
<p class='paragraphHeader'>"La Gran Aventura"</p>

<em>"Los Caracoles"</em>
</p>
<p><em>Entry for day  6: “Mendoza centro &gt; Uspallata. 6.4 Hard”</em></p>

<p>After a couple of more days of training rides in and around Mendoza,
the Great Adventure has finally begun…
although “Great Adventure” is probably an overstatement for an
activity that consists mostly of slogging up hills on a bicycle
hour after hour. 
My riding companions from BsAs arrived last night, and we met for dinner. 
They are an interesting and rowdy group. 
None speak a word of English, and they are Italian / <em>Porteño</em>
to the core: Ruben Galante, Hernan Galante, Quique DeLucca, and
Raul Escudero. 
All great names, and great guys. 
They are working class ex-bike racers of the Italian tradition who
now compete mostly in triathlons and running marathons. 
Alejandra warned me to be careful, because they may not like
<em>Norte Americanos</em> … but we hit it off immediately. 
They have the good-natured banter of athletes -- the kind of
people I am very comfortable with. 
You can be with a group of skiers, windsurfers, cyclists, or runners
from anywhere in the world, and you will almost certainly click. 
No matter how different their cultures or backgrounds, athletes
quickly become like brothers who harass and kid each other constantly. 
In sports, as well as in tango, Argentines like to use nicknames,
and I instantly become “<em>El Gringo</em>” (you don’t get to choose,
and I hear the word occasionally in the milongas as well). 
Quique is “<em>El Tarambana</em>”, which means, more or less, spaced out
and irresponsible, Hernan is “<em>El Nene</em>” (the baby), and
Raul is “<em>El Negro</em>”. 
They call Alejandra, who they know from running in marathon races,
“<em>Bisquit</em>”. 
Argentine nicknames are colorful, descriptive, with no sense at all
of political correctness. 
Depending on your nationality and physical characteristics, you may
become “The Fat Jew”, “The Big Nosed Turk”, or the “Chinese Parrot”. 
Diego, our driver for the trip became “<em>El Gordo</em>” because of his
weight problem. 
He said the name was hurting his morale, and might cause him to
drive us off a cliff, but the name stuck.</p>

<p>I  am a bit of a novelty for them. 
“Look at the <em>Gringo</em> taking <em>mate</em>!
Stop <em>bombilla</em> around!” (It plugs it up, they say). 
They are all addicted to <em>mate</em>, <em>bombilla</em>
(like a metal straw with a filter on the end) among friends as
the gourd is passed and refilled. 
The mate itself tastes a bit like bitter lawn clippings, but
it gives you a buzz -- which helps on long bike rides.</p>

<p>So the six of us begin riding on Thursday morning, weaving through
the early morning Mendoza traffic with a car in front with three
policeman / soldiers inside, one of whom is the head of the
<em>Gendarmeria Nacional</em> of the Province of Mendoza. W
e are followed by a truck with Diego driving, and Alejandra,
the coach and masseuse of our small cycling team. 
(Ruben has brought us all jerseys from our “sponsors”,
= succeed &quot;,&quot; do
  %em Privitera
= succeed &quot;,&quot; do
  %em Campagnolo
= succeed &quot;,&quot; do
  %em Potrerillos</p>

<p>The truth is, I was afraid of the Andes. 
I’m not a very good climber, and what little success I had in
cycling came from sprinting on flat, fast critierum courses. 
I thought I might explode, and have to suffer the ignominy of riding
over the top in the truck. 
I had tried to prepare in the mountains of Southern Arizona before
I came down, but it seemed like something always got in the way. 
On my last training ride before we left for Argentina, Alejandra and
I were on our way to Mexico in the car and I had her drop me off at
a place where I had trained for racing years before. 
I said, “Go on up to the observatory in the car, and I’ll see you in
a couple of hours.” 
It was the Kitt Peak National Observatory, and at the top of the
mountain she could take a tour of the telescopes and wait for me. 
I started riding hard, but I began to tire quickly. 
When I reached the base of the mountain, an hour had already gone by. 
I started the climb, and my speed began to drop. 
It’s a tough steep ride, and I had no food, and almost no water,
and it  was hot.
I began to get dehydrated,  I was bonking.
and I began to weave around in the road.
I was   “delivering letters”, as the French say. 
It means a bike rider is dying and weaving from one side of the
road to another as he climbs, like a mailman going from mailbox
to mailbox. 
At one point I even did a quick check for snakes and scorpions,
and lay down beside the road for a few minutes. 
I finally wobbled up to the summit three hours later, but my
confidence was shaken.</p>
<p>
However as we began to climb into the foothills of the Andes it seemed like these
<em>Porteños</em>
had trained even less than I had. In fact, I think it is probably impossible to train for riding in the Andes in flat, crowded BsAs. So as we rode toward
<em>Potrerillos</em>,
<em>Ruta 7</em>,
<em>Potrerillos</em>
about noon, and wait just past the small village at the checkpoint of the
<em>Gendarmeria Nacional</em>,
</p>
<p>
The
<em>Gendarmeria Nacional</em>
is one of three basic types basic of police power in Argentina. The military and the local police are the other two. The military has been badly tarnished by their involvement in the “dirty war” of the ‘70s and ‘80s, in which an estimated 30,000 Argentine citizens (and a few foreign ones as well) were tortured, murdered, and “disappeared”. It was their poor showing in the war against England over the Malvinas (Falkland Islands) that finally brought an end to their control of the country. (Today if you buy a map of Argentina, the islands will still be labeled
<em>Islas Malvinas (Arg.)</em>) The
<em>Casa Rosada</em>,
<em>Gendarmeria Nacional</em>.
</p>
<p class='paragraphHeader'>Incoming</p>
<p>
So I wait at the checkpoint, and after about 15 minutes Quique rolls in. We are standing by the small guardhouse at the mouth of the canyon just outside of town waiting for everyone else when there is a huge explosion. It actually shakes the ground, startling Quique and me. For a moment, I wonder if there is some sort of guerrilla attack beginning on the
<em>Gendarmes Nacional</em>
with whom we had been quietly chatting—but they aren’t running for their automatic weapons. And then a strange thing happens. Heavy objects begin falling out of the sky. Stuff is crackling through the tree branches, and whumping into the ground all around us. It seems to be coming  straight down, directly from above like rain. A couple of things hiss down nearby, and land with a thud. Branches and leaves are falling from the trees overhead, dust is kicked up, and it seems to dawn on everyone at the same time that we are being bombarded by rocks… and some of them are big! But before anyone can react, it is over. I walk around to the side of the guardhouse, and find a rock the size of a grapefruit that has impacted the earth exactly in the middle of the three-foot gap between the old metal guardhouse and the police car parked next to it. We look around and find more rocks. Some are golf ball sized, and some are much larger. Everyone just looks at each other, and one of the
<em>gendarmes</em>,
</p>
<p>It turns out that they are blasting a new road into the mountain above, and somebody used a little too much explosive. I now have a healthier respect for blasting. Being hit by one of those rocks could easily have been fatal, but the biggest disappointment for me is that the one I found fell exactly between the police car and the guardhouse. Wouldn’t it have been great if it had smashed through the roof of the car or the shed?</p>
<p>
We then climb another 25 miles and 1,500 feet to
<em>Uspallata</em>. Again,
<em>gendarme</em>
who has become our nursemaid since
<em>Potrerillos</em>
comes roaring around the corner on his cross-country motorbike, looking like the Road Warrior. He is quite a sight in his military armor and helmet on the bike, and the truckers and people along the road seem to have a tremendous respect for (or fear of?) him. He says hi, what’s up, and takes off back down the road. I’m not sure why he appeared. It is the only time I have seen him, but I find out later that he is worried to death that I will be squashed by a truck on the narrow roads, and has been roaring ahead on his motorbike to see if I am still alive and upright. It is the only time I ever know he is there, though, because the vistas are so long that he can go up the road, spot me a mile or so ahead, and then return to the group without my knowing it. I feel a little bad about making his life so tough. I feel like a little kid whose mom keeps sneaking looks out the kitchen window to see if he is okay.
</p>
<p>
We arrive in the village of
<em>Uspallata</em>
in the late afternoon. It’s not much, but I fall in love with the place immediately. (I find out later it was the location of a movie called
<em>Seven Years in Tibet</em>. I’ve
<em>Shangri-la</em>. If
</p>
<p>
I climb to
<em>Polvaredas</em>
where the group eventually rejoins. We rest at a small mountain school where we go inside and all the kids look at us in our cycling gear. In Argentina the grade school kids all wear white lab coats. They look like little tiny doctors, and they are very cute. It’s really more like a small warehouse than a school, and we use the bathrooms at one end that say “<em>Nenes</em>” and “<em>Nenas</em>” beside the doors. There are no toilets, just holes in the floor, and two footprints to show where you place your feet. The teachers and the principal come out, and we take some pictures with the school and the mountains. Then more climbing, through
<em>Punta de Vacas</em>,
<em>Puente del Inca</em>.
</p>
<p>
I am hoping to have them change my nickname from “<em>El Gringo</em>” to something like “<em>El Aguila de Los Andes</em>”, because they are now saying, look at the
<em>gringo</em>,
<em>Puente del Inca</em>,
</p>
<p>
After
<em>Puente del Inca</em>,
<em>Aconcagua</em>
lurks like a monster, with clouds and blowing snow trailing off into the bright cold air. The highest spot in all of North and South America. I’ve heard that people climb it all the time, but from where I sit on my bike it looks absolutely suicidal.
</p>
<p>
Well, the plan was to go over the Andes and across Chile to the Pacific Ocean, but the best-laid plans often go astray. First there is a chilly meeting at the mouth of the tunnel at the summit. Our
<em>gendarme</em>
fights for us. He does his best to argue our case, but somewhere among customs, immigration, and the Chilean or Argentine military, a decision is made that absolutely no way will we be allowed to ride the last few kilometers through the abandoned railroad tunnel that burrows under the final vertical spine of the
<em>Cordillera de los Andes</em>. The
<em>Los Caracoles</em>”
<em>Los Caracoles</em>”
<em>Los Caracoles</em>”

It was on the ride down in the truck that the trip really began to fall apart. Alberto, who had been having a rough time with his bike, and spent a lot of time riding in the truck, was disappointed that his arrangements to ride through the tunnel and down the other side had been cancelled. He suddenly decided he’d had enough and that we needed to drive straight to Santiago so he could fly back to BsAs. So instead of getting back on the bikes after leaving the restricted zone of “<em>Los Caracoles</em>” and riding on to the Chilean town of Los Andes as planned, we drove three hours to the Santiago airport and he jumped on a flight. Then, without our leader, things really got bad. Everyone was exhausted, and all of the hotels in Santiago were full because of some sort of huge religious convention. No one could decide anything. I sort of favored completing the ride to the coast one way or another, but with no hotel space, and a general dislike of everything Chilean by my
<em>Porteño</em>
teammates, it was finally decided to drive back up the mountain to Argentina . So, after 8 brutal hours on the bike, we put in another 10 hours cramped in a van with six bicycles. Instead of a hot shower, dinner, and bed, we rode until 230 a.m. in sweaty bike clothes, wet chamois and all, back to
<em>Uspallata</em>,

The numbers are not all that impressive. I can say that I did ride all the way to the top of the Andes, although technically not “over” them because we were stopped at the top, and not allowed to descend down the other side. We put in about 15 hours on the bike over two days, and climbed probably about 15,000 feet, counting the ups and downs, and much  of it was into a headwind. I had wanted to fly down the west face of the Andes and roll along through the Chilean wine country to the Pacific Ocean, but it was not to be. All we could manage on day three was a short ride back up toward
<em>Aconcagua</em>
from
<em>Uspallata</em>,
<em>Los Caracoles</em>
in the truck, some steep walled canyons, and then a seemingly endless drive through the smoggy, graffiti covered streets of Santiago. I guess Alberto’s political pull didn’t quite reach to the top of the Andes and over into the Chilean bureaucracy. Alejandra says he is like me… an okay guy, but a little spoiled, and ready to walk away from something as soon as he doesn’t like it anymore. But all and all it was a great experience, and it certainly beats sitting home and watching television.
