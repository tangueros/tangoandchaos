We are back from a week in Uruguay, tanned, rested, and ready to
resume reporting on tango and tourism in Greater Buenos Aires and
suburbs and this report is about a very, very far suburb:</p>

<h1>Where is Everybody?</h1>

<p><em>Uruguay, Friday, July 18:</em>
We arrived Friday evening on the <em>Buquebus</em> hydrofoil boat from BsAs,
and the contrast with the 24-hour raucous party and automobile
demolition derby that is Buenos Aires was immediately apparent.
The streets of central Montevideo seemed practically deserted.
There were almost no cars, and almost no pedestrians.
We saw the same beautiful old buildings BsAs has, but no one was
around.
We were shuttled to a big hotel on the main plaza that was almost empty.
They advertise Montevideo as the safest city in the world, and it
may be true.
A career in street crime must be difficult when there is no one to rob.
Also the few people we did see were old, and the 60-70 year old
demographic is not heavily populated with armed robbers.</p>

<p>After an unsuccessful search for a Friday night milonga, and
dinner in an empty parrilla, we called it a night.
The next day was sunny and breezy and we strolled the city,
<em>sin rumbo fijo</em>.</p>

<p><em>Granadero</em> uniforms, the colorful dress cavalry uniforms of the
old days.
I decided to use Alejandra&#39;s camera to take a picture of them in
their tall hats, guarding a huge statue of a general on a horse with
a pigeon on his head.
When I got closer, they snapped to attention, and watched me out of
the corners of their eyes while I took the shot.
Then, when I turned and left, they resumed chatting and looking
around the plaza like any group of teenage boys hanging out and
looking for girls.
Which they were.
This relaxed attitude seemed to be everywhere, in sharp contrast to
the edgy nervousness of Buenos Aires.
We walked along the sea wall and watched the commercial shipping
come and go.
On this quiet Saturday in the old central part of town, reasonably
affluent Montevideo had the appearance of an economic backwater
that has been isolated under the thumb of some eccentric dictator.
Along the waterfront there are broad avenues with almost no traffic.
Occasionally a smoking 55 Chevy or ancient Fiat or Renault would
come putt-putting by with the occupants peering curiously out of
the side windows at the world drifting slowly by.
The residents are very friendly, but despite constantly sucking on
<em>mate</em> gourds, which should wake them up, they have a dreamy, almost
addled,  no worries  attitude.
This is a real change from the energetic <em>Porteños</em>,</p>

<p><em>18 de Julio</em>)</p>

<p><em>colectivo 12</em> (<em>el doce</em>) is a Mr. Toad&#39;s wild ride, threading the
needle between taxis and trucks, with pedestrians diving for cover.
A friend of mine was almost killed when a hurrying bus driver
clamped the rear door shut on his foot before he could step down.
He was dragged down the street, watching the rear wheel rolling
inches from his head, until the screams of the passengers finally
stopped the driver.
But Montevideo is so safe and tranquil that I even saw bicycles
parked around town without locks on them.</p>

<p>If tango is alive and well in BsAs, it is, well... alive in Montevideo.
The schedule says there are a lot of milongas, but they were hard
to find.
Nothing Friday, and on Saturday the advertised location was closed and
dark with no explanation.
We finally found something, a special twice a month event in a
fantastic spot called <em>Mercado de la Abundancia</em>.
<em>fulgor</em> of tango!
This may have been the birthplace of tango, but if tango ever was
here, it grew up and took the <em>Buquebus</em> to BsAs.</p>

<p>The location was great, an old market that took up almost an entire
city block, with a high old ornate metal roof with skylights.
Four parrillas smoked away inside, but the roof was so high that
the air remained clear.
There was a big crowd, made up mostly of people who came to eat at
the restaurants and watch the dancing.
It was a fun spot with nice people, but I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ve become a bit
of a tango snob, because I have to say that the music and the dancing
were not very good.
The first music played seemed to be by the well-known orchestras,
but it was hard to recognize.
They had the right orchestras, but they seemed to have picked versions
recorded for a concert, rather than for dancing.
I kept asking Alejandra if she had ever heard this music before, and
she hadn&#39;t.
Finally she resorted to an old habit I had picked up in the U.S.
She went up and had a talk with the DJ.
He said he knew it wasn&#39;t much, but he couldn&#39;t change it.
The people who ran the market furnished it, and it was a continuous tape.
Finally the tape ended, and he took control of the music, but it
really wasn&#39;t a lot better.
It was a random mix of everything, and I realized how much I had
come to rely on and appreciate the pro DJs of BsAs.
There were no <em>cortinas</em> to separate the tandas, and the music had
no flow or continuity.
A <em>vals</em> followed a <em>milonga</em>, then Calo, then maybe De Caro, or
performance style Pugliese followed by another milonga.
We found ourselves getting up and sitting back down like a second
string tackle being shuttled in and out of a football game.
It really made me appreciate and understand the purpose of
well-organized tandas separated by <em>cortinas</em>. <em>baldosa</em> dancing.
I stayed almost in one spot, arms in tight, doing close giros and
short rock steps.
Almost immediately the guy in front of me took a big back step into us.
Then we were brushed from behind by a couple dancing with an open,
elbows out, leg throwing style.
A minute later we were almost hit by someone drifting out from the
middle of the floor.
I was almost expecting the table to dance over and kick us before the
music ended.
I asked Alejandra if she was okay, and we gave up.</p>

<p>We tried dancing later in one of the aisles that led into the dining
tables of the <em>parrilla</em>,
<em>Porteños</em> are used to charging around heavy traffic in cars and
buses, always inches from disaster.
These people may not be used to it.
Crowds fluster them, and they don&#39;t have the skills to move in
close quarters.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to say the people are rude. Just the opposite.
They are very nice, but they just don&#39;t seem to get tango.
We talked to a woman next to us and she said,
We are not like <em>Porteños</em>.</p>

<p><em>candombe</em> group danced into the place, drums banging away.
The crowd seemed to shed its inhibitions and acquire a sudden grace.
<em>Candombe</em> is said to one of the predecessors of milonga and tango,
but it&#39;s hard to see the connection.
It is a very loose African Cuban type of thing that, to me, has
little resemblance to tango.</p>

<p>On Sunday we took a long walk along the <em>rambla</em>,
<em>Don Trigo</em> that night.
It was held in the small back room of the restaurant, in <em>Pocitos</em>,
<em>destornillador</em> (for which I have acquired quite a taste lately)
and tried to play the role of the objective reporter.
Let&#39;s see: small wooden floor, six to eight couples dancing,
disco ball spinning with lights.
The dancers all seemed to be beginners, but they were trying very
hard to follow the music in their awkward beginners&#39; way.
Again the music, and we talked to the DJ, Daniel.
A very nice man, but he said that in Montevideo they only like
slow tangos like Calo, or Pugliese.
The faster music of BsAs doesn&#39;t suit them.
But he was very nice, and hunted up some Tanturi just for us.</p>

<p>Maybe it was the drink, but I began feel bad about reporting on them.
These people weren&#39;t trying to perform for anyone.
They were very sincere people, trying to follow the music, with none
of the self-satisfied smugness (sorry I have to say it) that sometimes
seems apparent in milongas of the U.S.
And I felt like I was spying on them for other people.
Is it possible I could say something that could actually hurt someone,
or maybe damage a club or a milonga down here?
I am looking over my shoulder and second-guessing, and that&#39;s not
a good thing... in writing, or in tango dancing.</p>

<p>Afterwards we went to eat in a nice <em>parrilla</em>, <em>Porteños</em>,</p>

<p>We are off to Colonia to relax for a few days, and then back to BsAs.</p>

<p>(A note from my editor, Alejandra. She says:
1. It should be made clear that the pigeon on the head of General
Artigas in Plaza Independencia was a wild one that landed there, and
was not part of the statue, and that:
2. The incident I described where Ed got his foot caught in the door
of the bus was an isolated one, and was maybe even his fault, and
should in no way be taken as a slur on the clean, safe, and reliable
municipal bus service of Buenos Aires, nor on any of its dedicated
employees.)</p>
