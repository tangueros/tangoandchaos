<p>What makes tango different?
As we studied the dancers of Buenos Aires, it became more and more
clear that the tango we see today did not come from people
practicing in studios.
Tango didn’t come from people inventing steps in dance classes, nor
did it come from choreographers designing performances for stage
entertainment.
Argentine tango, both its origin and its creative core, begins and
ends in the clubs and the streets of Buenos Aires.
Tango (both tango dancing and tango music) is the direct result of
the special conditions that exist in Buenos Aires .
It was born there, it grew there, and, the dancing continues to evolve
there today.</p>

<p>For this reason, any attempt to understand the nature of the music and
the physical movement of tango must begin there.
So in this section, I would like to present a few examples to support
the argument that the form in which tango is danced today is a
practical and efficient design that has evolved for more than 100
years in the unique and splendid isolation of Buenos Aires.
Almost like a discreet ecosystem on a remote island, tango is the
happy result of trial and error.
A natural system in which bad designs die out and new and efficient
ones prosper.</p>

<p>There are two huge influences on tango dancing—two special conditions isolated in Argentina that have affected everything—the posture, the walk, the embrace, and the cadences, figures and patterns of tango as well. They are:  crowding, and the bandoneon. Anyone who’s been to BsAs knows how crowded it is in milongas, and the old picture above shows that the crowds have always around. It’s always a shock to leave tango classes and discover the harsh reality of the milonga. Dreams of dancing like Pablo Veron on that empty floor in the movie are shattered… and many students never recover.</p>
<p>Movement in crowded conditions requires two basic things: the ability to stop, start, and change direction easily (maneuverability), and the ability to remain stable and secure when the inevitable bumping occurs. Look at the way the milongueros in the following pictures are standing:</p>

Five well-known milongueros from all over  Buenos Aires are pictured above.  Top:  Pocho who dances mostly downtown (at
<em>Lujos</em>).
<em>El Beso</em>),
<em>El Chino</em>
(at
<em>Sin Rumbo</em>),
<em>Banco Provincia</em>).
</p>
<p class='pictureCaption'></p>
<p>One afternoon in <em>Region Leonesa</em>, Pocho came over and told me,
“You shouldn’t stand with your feet parallel.
It’s better to point your toes out like this:
%font{:size =&gt; &quot;4&quot;} %strong \ /
.
The <em>diez y diez</em> (ten minutes after ten on a clock face) position is
the most stable. No one can knock you down.”
Pocho is one of the most respected tango dancers in the world, so of
course I paid attention.
I began to look around, and I noticed that almost all of the good
dancers were standing this way.
Because milongueros must sometimes pause to avoid collisions, often
in very tight spaces where the risk of bumping  is highest,
stability is important.
So, these dancers, all from different barrios of BsAs, have all
evolved into the same stable
= succeed &quot;\u{a0}shaped,&quot; do
  %font{:size =&gt; &quot;4&quot;}
    %strong \ /</p>

<p>“Form follows function” means that when something works well, it
begins to look good.
(Alej has warned me about using sports analogies -- but I can’t resist).
Forty years ago, skiers used a very upright, feet together stance,
with their arms held casually at their sides.
This was considered very elegant -- and gliding gracefully down
groomed slopes with their skis locked together like Stein Ericson
was everyone’s idea of perfection.
Today, the best skiers use a more crouching, feet apart, arms out
style -- a stance that used to be considered the mark of bad skiing.
Because of this more efficient, athletic position, skiers today can
ski more of the mountain at higher speeds than ever before, and this
technique has become the one everyone aspires to.
Like the tango of the milongueros, it is a sort of rough art that is
beautiful because it works.</p>
