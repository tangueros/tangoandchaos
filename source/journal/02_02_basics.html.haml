    # The Elements of Style

    In the process of going through the many hours of video we took
    in Buenos Aires, I found that patterns began to emerge.
    Although each of the dancers had their own different style, certain
    common markers of good technique kept showing up.
    The pictures below give an insight into the mechanics of the best
    dancers.
    A serious student who can develop a mental picture of these key
    elements and practice them with the aid of a mirror should move to
    a new level.
    After all, if the milongueros were able to learn tango by watching
    each other dance, shouldn’t we be able to do the same?
    Please keep in mind that these pictures weren’t selected for their
    artistic quality.
    They are pictures of every day milonga dancing, not performances or
    demonstrations.
    Here are the three essential elements of good technique:

      Always place each foot directly in front of the other when walking.

      %img{:alt => "Blas y Graciela", :height => "300", :hspace => "10", :src => "2_pics/image003.jpg", :vspace => "7", :width => "191"}/
      %img{:alt => "Lili y Napo", :height => "300", :hspace => "10", :src => "2_pics/image005.jpg", :vspace => "7", :width => "143"}/
      %br/

      Lead with the chest, especially when moving forward from a stop.

      %img{:alt => "Graciela y Blas", :height => "300", :hspace => "10", :src => "2_pics/image007.jpg", :vspace => "7", :width => "140"}/

      Step solidly onto a straight leg... never onto a bent knee.
      %br/
      %img{:alt => "Tete", :height => "300", :hspace => "15", :src => "2_pics/image013.jpg", :vspace => "7", :width => "193"}/

      %img{:alt => "Ismael", :height => "300", :hspace => "15", :src => "2_pics/image017.jpg", :vspace => "7", :width => "184"}/
      %div{:align => "center"}
        %font{:size => "-1"}

    Walking with the weight forward (2) and stepping with weight onto a
    straight leg (3) is hard to learn but it's what gives tango its
    characteristic look.
    Dancers who do it naturally are sometimes spoken of in the milongas as
    being *muy autentico* or *muy Argentino*.
