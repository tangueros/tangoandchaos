    Introduction
  :markdown
    In November 2001 I flew down to Argentina for a  five-week vacation.
    The following stories were posted on several Internet  groups
    during that trip.
    They describe my adventures and struggles while trying  to learn
    tango in the old dance halls and clubs of Buenos Aires.
    Those of you who make the long  scroll through these pages will
    see that, as often happens in life, I got much  more than I
    bargained for when that beautiful city began to unravel.
    Those who  want to  jump directly to the dramatic events of
    December 19 that changed Argentina,

  %p.paragraphHeader{:align => "center"} A Report From the Heart of Tango
  :markdown
    *Sat Dec 8, 2001 3:36 pm* --
    I am in Buenos Aires accompanied by the loyal Malik, who is in
    charge of security on this dangerous trip.
    Malik and I have endured the close embrace of hundreds of
    Argentine women, as well as the rigors of the Latin American
    banking system, and our extensive research has resulted in the
    following rules of survival for any who wish to follow in our
    footsteps:
    1. Listen to the music.
    2. Less is more.
    3. Don't forget your PIN number.
    That’s it for now.

    *Mon Dec 10, 2001 12:43 pm* --
    We’re going to Patagonia next week to see the penguins.
    I will be back in Tucson around  Christmas, and I’m looking
    forward to seeing you all at Steve and Mimi’s big New Year's party!

    *Mon Dec 10, 2001 12:43 pm* --
    We had to leave so early to catch our flight to Patagonia
    this morning that we decided to stay up all night and dance,
    and then leave for the airport at 5am.
    This was not a good idea.
    We went all the way out to the airport and missed the flight.
    So, I’m back at the apartment with some time to write.

    The economy is sinking fast here.
    There was a run on the banks two weeks ago, and last week the
    government unexpectedly restricted the  amount of money that
    people can withdraw from their accounts to $250 per week.
    Everyone is a little frightened.
    The peso is officially linked to the dollar at one to one, but
    it will probably be devalued, and that could be a disaster for
    anyone holding pesos (including gringo tourists).
    Obtaining cash is a problem here.
    Banks and credit card offices are jammed with people.
    I tried to get a cash advance on my Visa, and found that all
    cash advances in Argentina were stopped over the weekend.
    Traveler's checks, which I mistakenly brought, are no longer
    payable in dollars, and there is only one very jammed location
    where you can cash them at all.

    The first few nights I was here I chose to walk home alone from
    the milongas at  4am, but I’ve stopped doing it after all of
    the stories I heard about recent  increases in street crime.
    The subways here are great.
    You can get almost  anywhere fast for 75 cents, but they stop
    running at 10pm, so taxis or buses  are really the only option
    late at night.
    There was a well publicized incident  where the husband of the
    country's most famous television news lady was stabbed  7 times
    by a cab driver who was robbing him, so everyone is warning us
    about  the cabs also.
    We try to take only cabs that say "Radio Taxi" on  them, and
    I try for additional security by looking for old drivers.
    I figure if  Malik (who looks like he plays power forward for
    the Lakers) and I get mugged  by a 70-year-old man, we probably
    deserve it.

    At first the milongas were so crowded that it was a real
    challenge to dance.
    Practice tip: Stand in one of the endless lines at the bank
    with a partner.
    Dance until you reach the front of the line.
    The amount of space you have and  the speed at which you move will
    approximate about one hour of tango at the  most popular milongas.
    That was the case up until last weekend, anyway.
    The  economic crisis cut the attendance at the milongas
    dramatically, so there’s now  more room to dance.
    Unfortunately, everyone is so nervous that they seem to be
    smoking twice as much, so the second hand smoke factor remains
    about the same.

    It’s easy to fall into a degenerate lifestyle down here.
    We’re usually out all  night and sleeping most of the day.
    There are five of us in the apartment, and  everyone sleeps late,
    so it seems normal.
    Malik and I, and Renee Linnell from San Diego are the three
    tango tourists sharing an old time  3d-floor apartment
    with a local girl named Malena, and a student from Colombia.
    Picture some of the coolest old places in "The Tango Lesson"
    movie,  and you'll have an idea of what it looks like.
    Luckily we've all become great  friends.
    Malena, the *porteña* (local) is the rebellious daughter
    of a prominent  local family that survived the "dirty war"
    in the 70´s by leaving the  city, and having private
    soldiers guarding the family home.
    She takes us around  in an old beat up car, and I’m afraid
    my name is going to get on some bad list  by hanging out with her.
    She knows it’s a little dangerous even now to walk
    around wearing a Che Guevara T-shirt, but she doesn't seem to care.
    That’s all  for now.
    I’m getting a little sleepy.

    After re-reading this, I think I’ve  painted a pretty bleak picture.
    Nothing could be farther from the truth.
    Actually, I’ve never been to a place I like as much as BA.
    *Quiero Buenos Aires!*
    When I get time, I will write some more and tell why.

    *Tue Dec 11, 2001 7:05 am* --
    I got a couple of emails asking for more reports from Buenos Aires
    (thanks Homer), so here are some  notes I made on the flight down,
    and after the first day.
    I wasn't going to  post it because it ain't so good and most of it
    ain't tango, but after reading  some of the recent stuff posted on
    the group, I guess it doesn't matter.

    *BsAs report- Day 1 -*
    Traveling in style --
    I can’t lose the thought that I’ve  forgotten to do something or
    bring something, and that I’ll return in a month  to financial ruin
    and a burned out house covered with graffiti.
    I’m not a very  good traveler anymore -- just the thought of packing
    and driving to a crowded  airport for a 16-hour plane ride
    causes me to lose half a night’s sleep.
    And it didn't help that my ride showed up late  and said the
    brakes were bad on his  car  and it wouldn't make it to the airport.
    I was forced to call someone else at the last minute, and I had
    one of those run through the airport and squeeze onto the plane
    just as they close the door experiences.
    I could feel the pulse in my temple pounding as I settled into
    my seat, and the airport anxiety didn't fade until after we
    finally took off.

    But at least I am traveling in *style*!

    It’s now night and my seat, which transforms itself into every
    possible position,  has become a large, comfortable bed in a
    private space.
    I have eyeshades,  feather pillows, a set of noise suppression
    earphones, plenty of room, and I’m  ready to try to get some sleep.
    I’m pretty excited, though. I just peeked out  the window and saw
    the moon reflecting off of a winding river, surrounded by  what
    I assume is dense black rainforest.
    We’re cruising along 7 miles high,  over huge snakes and alligators
    and jungles and drug lords, down over the  equator, for my first time
    to the bottom half of the world, and the heart of  Tango!

    *Morning* --
    Despite the comfortable bed on the airplane, I couldn't sleep much.
    I  checked my wristwatch all night, and finally dozed off a couple
    of hours before  arrival.
    I just raised the shades on the windows, and we’re flying low
    through  puffy scattered clouds, with the city off to the east in
    the haze, across miles  of green, tropical looking Argentine farmland.
    There is light turbulence and  the giant wing is flexing up and
    down about 10 feet at the tip.
    I can also see the  monstrous port engine moving around and bouncing.
    Weird.

    *Day 2 - The eagle has landed* --
    The airport is mostly international modern, but at its core is a
    large spooky  stained concrete structure that has an old time
    third-world feel to it.
    I  couldn't help but remember that this was the sight of a notorious
    massacre  where troops with automatic weapons killed hundreds of
    young protestors in the  not very distant past.
    I wondered if there were any bullet craters in the  walls.
    South American politics -- what a nightmare.
    The thought sobered me up for  the trip through customs, but
    it was simple and uneventful.
    I was first off the  plane, first bags off the carousel, first
    through immigration, and first  through customs (they have a
    little stop light just like Mexico - I got  a green).
    After the first class treatment on the airplane, I was hoping
    my  advance man Malik would have a bulletproof limo and
    motorcycle escort so I  could cruise Nixon-like into town... but no.
    I was forced to catch a noisy  shuttle bus, which circled all over
    the city and then transfer to another that  did the same.
    I was dropped off disoriented on a busy city street.
    Look at the  Yankee tourist!
    It’s hard not to feel self-conscious dragging heavy luggage
    down the sidewalk in a foreign city.

    The apartment is through a small door, and up a long flight of
    winding marble  steps.
    It’s very old, with high ceilings, small rooms, chandeliers,
    and a  couple of small balconies that look onto the busy street
    that will become my  neighborhood over the next month.
    It also has a long atrium like airshaft, some  winding metal
    stairs to access the roof, and a view of the BA skyline.
    When I  arrive it’s noisy, with cigarette smoke and tango
    music blasting while the  owner and her partner practice for some demo.
    It’s full of people, and I’m not  feeling too sociable. Oh well.

    *First night* -- Get *El Beso*.
    *Norte Americanos* in  the place, and
    they are speaking some type of Spanish that I can’t even understand.
    5 weeks of this will be intolerable.
    Maybe I can get an early  flight home.
    To be continued...

    Thu Dec 13, 2001 3:58 pm --
    The Argentines know that in tango, as in life, attitude is everything.
    This of  course isn't always true (as they found out very quickly
    in the Falklands War),  but it works most of the time.
    Malik has pointed out to me that many of the  Argentine men aren't
    really that good, but that they think they are, and that  such
    an attitude adjustment would benefit my dancing.
    And just like that, it  happened.
    In my last post I was sitting dejected and exhausted in *El Beso*
    on my  first night in BA.
    But things always seem to get better, don’t they?
    A good  nights sleep was the main thing, and then a little ego
    boost from being placed  in the advanced class the next evening
    did the trick.
    So, every dog has his  day, no?

    We were back at *El Beso* on my second night for classes,
    and it's all locals.
    *Clarin*, *porteños* have learned to  dance tango in these
    classes than anywhere else (you  probably know this already,
    but BsAs is a port city, and the people who live here  are
    port people -- hence, *"porteño"*).
    *Castellano/Lunfardo* instruction is very hard to understand.
    Since Malik and I  are the only *gringos*
    in the large classes, there is no translation furnished.
    The classes are large, and everyone starts  out in one big group.
    There was a break after an hour and a half (cigarettes
    everywhere), and then the class was divided.
    To my surprise they  placed me in  the advanced group, which
    Anna Maria (who runs the school) teaches.
    And to make it better,  they happened to be teaching some stuff
    that I was familiar with from all of my  Tete video watching.
    In fact I had practiced these things many times at my  house,
    which made me appear better than I really am.

    At 1130pm, right after the class, the milonga starts -- and
    it’s a good one.
    Everyone paired up to dance, and I sat down by myself.
    Anna Maria caught my  eye, and called me over.
    "*Salimos?*" she said.
    She was asking me to  dance, which is very unusual down here.
    But maybe if you're one of the best  milongueras in BsAs you do
    what you want.
    I would like to tell you that she was  so taken by my skill
    that she couldn't help herself, but I know the truth.
    She  was essentially the hostess, and I was the only
    *Americano* (other than Malik),  as well as a paying customer,
    and I was a newcomer sitting by myself.
    I said,  "*Lo siento, pero tengo miedo*".
    It did me no good.
    Afraid or  not, I was dragged onto the dance floor.
    It didn't help that Carlos Gavito had been watching the classes,
    and was now sitting at the edge of  the dance floor watching us.
    We danced three or four dances, and I won’t pretend it was  good.
    I was barely able to stay with the music.
    But, Anna Maria Shapira is a *maestra*
    of close-embrace tango, and she is so incredibly easy to  dance
    with that I survived it.
    It broke the ice for me, and gave me a little  confidence.

    Now, I know that performing is a big part of tango, and that
    many of the best  tango dancers in the world perform.
    I love to watch them.
    My own personal passion,  however, is for a more internal experience.
    It’s why I have been struggling for  so long with the
    close embrace style.
    It’s not as pretty to watch as performance tango, and it looks  simple.
    But it’s deceptive.
    It’s very close to the music.
    Subtle feelings can  pass between the partners that may be lost in
    a more open and demonstrative  style.
    It’s not understood or taught at all in my part of the country,
    and the  best thing about this trip is that I think I am finally
    beginning to understand  some things about it.
    All of the tango clichés, "feel the music",  "learn to walk",
    "take care of the woman", are starting to  have real meaning for me.

    Unfortunately for me the unstoppable confidence roller coaster races on.
    One  moment I’m the Baron of Buenos Aires, the next I’m afraid to
    get back on the  floor -- stumbling and clumsy.
    Shakespeare, brilliant and cynical: I “strut and  fret” through tango.
    I strut and fret through a life "full of sound and  fury,
    signifying nothing".
    There are good dances, okay dances, and bad  dances.
    And then there are the disasters where I actually break into a
    nervous  flop sweat before they are over, struggling and
    claustrophobic on the crowded  floor, smiling nervously at
    some disappointed Argentine woman as I slink away.

    But I would like to finish this post with a triumph.
    Nothing major, but maybe  something of significance.
    Perhaps a small step forward.
    It was a few days ago,  and I was in a class, feeling a little
    bored and tired.
    They were teaching  something difficult that I really didn't
    like, and I was trying to keep a low  profile and do as little
    as possible.
    Uh oh! I was rotated to the last person I  wanted as a partner.
    She’s, an older heavy instructor who’s probably danced  tango
    for 30 years.
    She never smiles, or says anything, except for sharp and frequent
    corrections.
    The system in this class is to work on the technique, then play
    music while some instructors rotate dances with the students,
    and others wander  and correct.
    After the music ends, there are more demo/corrections, and then
    another piece of music.
    So the music started. Posture, check. Shoulders down  and back.
    Check. I made the embrace, forward with the chest, and leaned in
    slightly, waiting for the music, and then began.
    But I couldn't begin the  practice step!
    I walked forward a little.
    Step, step, pause. Step, step, pause.
    Then the music began to get to me.
    I think it was Di Sarli.
    It happens  sometimes, especially when I’m tired.
    Step and step - step, - step, pause.
    I  couldn't bring myself to begin whatever we were supposed
    to be practicing, and  the emotion in the music was really in me.
    I just began to walk, and the music  was really, really there.
    More slow steps, maybe a rock, pause, step and step.
    Then a larger surging step.
    I was waiting for this woman to yank me back,
    and  start impatiently putting me through the practice stuff.
    Nothing.
    The music was  through me, into her, and we just walked.
    Simple.
    It seemed like a few seconds,  but it was an entire song.
    The music stopped, and she said nothing, and did  nothing for a moment.
    Then, she squeezed my left hand twice.

    Next, there are demos.
    Students are doing something wrong, and they are trying  to
    correct it, but I can’t pay attention.
    The music begins, Di Sarli again I  think this time.
    Maybe Biaggi.
    It’s in me even more, and there is no way I can  do what we
    are supposed to practice.
    I just begin to move.
    Occasionally in the  packed milongas the crowd seems to be
    moving more or less together, a sort of  pausing, playing or
    fussing, then a surging - swooping step, and a pause again.
    When it happens, late at night on a large dance floor, it’s
    amazing to watch.
    Everyone feels it.
    It looks like a flock of long legged shore birds --
    feeding  in the water for a moment, then taking a long graceful step.
    Not exactly  together, but kind of together.
    Pause and surge... and I am feeling this  elegant movement.
    The music tugs you along, like a child with a wagon on a  rope;
    the child pauses to play and then, giving his wagon a tug, moves again.
    The music tugs me around the floor… and this older heavier woman
    is with me  completely.
    She seems to know each step before I take it.
    The music is through  me, into her.
    Absolutely simple.
    Step, pause, a little weight change, swoop, a  short step and a
    longer step.
    Maybe a quick, sharp milonguero step, or maybe a  softer one.
    Pause, very still.
    Then slightly rocking, and a surge forward,  moving among the
    struggling couples and the lurking instructors.
    Very, very  simple.
    It was nothing. It was everything.
    Freed by the music.
    Then it ends,  and again the two left hand squeezes,
    harder this time, and she says quietly to  herself "*Lindo, lindo*",
    ...a comment that is not meant for me.
    Maybe  for a moment there is no economic collapse in this sad and
    beautiful country.
    For a moment the students aren’t quite as annoying.
    She gives me a sidelong  glance that says, okay, you got away
    with it this time.
    And I think to myself,  you know, these old milongueros;
    these are not guys who just do what they are  told all the time.

  %p.paragraphHeader Malik's Big Adventure
  %p
    The distinctions keep piling up for Malik.
    Not only is he the world’s tallest African  American  tango dancer,
    he may be the world’s tallest tango  dancer, period.
    After we missed the Patagonia  flight, I decided to stay in BA.
    He stubbornly insisted on catching a flight  alone the next day,
    and now it looks like he is stranded.
    The economic crisis  is now worse, and the airlines in Argentina
    are out of money and out  of gas.
    They stopped all flights, and his last email says he is stuck
    somewhere  far to the south.
    Maybe *Tierra del Fuego*.
