          The first picture below shows how <em>Petroleo</em> opened the embrace, and began to take large forward steps&hellip; but he is still hunched forward a bit, in the old style.&nbsp;The next picture shows Todaro.&nbsp;He has straightened up, and moved his shoulders back.&nbsp;He stands in the more upright posture used by modern stage dancers.&nbsp;The best stage performers today  stay up,  centered, and often separated, which gives them the balance and space necessary for athletic stage moves:<br /></p>

      <p>The four pictures above are a textbook study of good modern social tango.&nbsp;They represent different barrios, different dancing styles, and even different generations&mdash;but they are identical!&nbsp;These milongueros have all of the characteristics that we discussed in the &ldquo;Secrets of the Milongueros&rdquo; section.&nbsp;Each one stands tall, leads with the chest, and steps with all of his weight onto a straight leg.&nbsp;Did it all begin with <em>Fino</em>?&nbsp;I think it probably did.</p>

      <p> The predominant dancing style in the milongas today is a moving, close embrace style, punctuated with pauses for turns and figures.&nbsp;Even the most complex <em>giros</em> or figures are often done with little or no separation between the partners.&nbsp;This is more or less Alejandra&rsquo;s and my style, but we don&rsquo;t teach it or advocate it.&nbsp;We just find, like most people in BsAs today, that it&rsquo;s the most comfortable and efficient way to dance in crowded milongas.&nbsp;The question is how did tango arrive at this style of close dancing?&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s trace the evolution of one specific tango step to see what we can learn.&nbsp;The step is sometimes called an <em>ocho cortado</em>, or an inside <em>ocho</em>, where the man leads the woman&rsquo;s left leg to step forward in front of him.&nbsp;Her leg must pass inside the dance frame, between the two partners, and she often finishes in a cross.&nbsp;Most beginners are probably exposed to it in their first few weeks of classes.</p>
      <p> In the beginning, because the partners didn&rsquo;t actually face each other, taking this step was very easy to do.&nbsp;In fact, most of the steps the woman took in the old style of embrace were &ldquo;inside&rdquo;, in the sense that both partners faced almost the same direction while dancing, so the woman&rsquo;s left leg stepped along side the man, &ldquo;inside&rdquo; the embrace.&nbsp;But then <em>Petroleo</em> began dancing more face to face, and the step became more difficult.&nbsp;Here is how he did it:</p>

        <span class="pictureCaption"><em>Petroleo&rsquo;s ocho cortado</em>.</span> <br />
        <br />
      <p>This step should be familiar to most tango dancers.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s often taught today in the manner <em>Petroleo</em> is demonstrating:&nbsp;He moves his partner around to his right side, like in the old days, and then he brings her back in front, guiding her leg between them with his right arm.&nbsp;Notice that he bends forward to allow space for the woman&rsquo;s leg to pass in front of him.&nbsp;The woman often finishes in front, facing him in a cross.</p>
      <p> Now let&rsquo;s look at Todaro:<br /></p>
     <img src="3_pics/10ascent/image035.jpg" alt="" width="203" height="384" hspace="20" vspace="5" class="picborder" />
          <br />
          <span class="pictureCaption">Todaro's <em>ocho cortado</em>.</span><br />
          <br />
         <p>The picture above shows that Todaro is more upright than <em>Petroleo</em>.&nbsp;His legs are straight, so his knees are not blocking his partner&rsquo;s path.&nbsp;By being up, he creates room for her to pass in front, without needing to bend forward at the waist.&nbsp;But this is still being done with both partners separated&mdash;there is some space between their bodies.&nbsp;Now let&rsquo;s look the <em>ocho cortado</em> of the 21st century milonga: <br />
      </p>
         <img src="3_pics/10ascent/Mil20.jpg" alt="" width="164" height="275" hspace="20" vspace="10" class="picborder" /><img src="3_pics/10ascent/Mil21.jpg" alt="" width="138" height="275" hspace="20" vspace="10" class="picborder" /><img src="3_pics/10ascent/Mil22.jpg" alt="" width="145" height="275" hspace="20" vspace="10" class="picborder" /><br />
           <img src="3_pics/10ascent/Mil23.jpg" alt="" width="140" height="275" hspace="20" vspace="10" class="picborder" /><img src="3_pics/10ascent/Mil24.jpg" alt="" width="151" height="275" hspace="20" vspace="10" class="picborder" /><img src="3_pics/10ascent/Mil25.jpg" alt="" width="148" height="275" hspace="20" vspace="10" class="picborder" /><br />
           <span class="pictureCaption"><em>Fino</em> and Maria Teresa: the <em>ocho cortado</em>.<br /> 
           30 years ago <em>Fino</em> began to show the modern style.</span><br />
           <br />
           <br />
           
         <p>In the captures above, <em>Fino </em>and Maria Teresa&rsquo;s posture and balance are the key.&nbsp;<em>Fino&rsquo;s</em> chest is up and forward, his legs are straight, and his heels are together.&nbsp;Maria is also up, straight, and slightly forward.&nbsp;The result is that Maria&rsquo;s leg can pass between them without the need for <em>Fino</em> to bend at the waist, or for the partners to step apart.&nbsp;<em>Fino</em> doesn&rsquo;t have to move her over to his right side to begin because the lead is from the chest, and the space to take the step already exists.&nbsp;What  a beautiful set of pictures.</p>
