    <p class="paragraphHeader">Mastering the Music </p>
    <p>I think  <em>El Chino's </em>dancing is about as good as it gets, but sometimes  understanding the tango of  the great milongueros requires a &quot;<em>Clik!</em>&quot;, as the <em>porte&ntilde;os</em> say&mdash;a shift of perception.  The best milongueros   think of dancing   in terms  of  <em> why </em>you  move, rather than<em> how</em> you move. That means you shouldn't step or turn just because you can&mdash;you step, or turn, for  a reason. </p>
    <p><em>El Chino's</em> tango is made up of three basic movements, and he only uses them  when he hears something he wants to follow. You could think of a tango dancer   as musical instrument that has   three ways of playing  along with the rest of the orchestra<strong>:</strong> moving  around the floor in different directions,    turning around an axis, and   moving up and down. On this page, well look at how <em>El Chino</em> and Noem&iacute; use the first two<strong>:</strong> stepping around the plain of the floor, and turning around their axis.  </p>
    <p>In our first example, <em>El Chino</em> uses forward movement  to express the music<strong>:</strong> </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If you listen  carefully, you'll hear the piano  begin to mark the <em>comp&aacute;s</em> with  several bass chords. <em>El Chino</em> waits, and then he follows  them, <em>Boom... bom-Boom</em>; first  with a medium length forward step, and then with a longer, more emphatic one. By waiting for the right moment, and then carefully using the simplest tool in tango,  he's able to  masterfully express a small bit of music.</p>
    <p>On the next page, we'll examine  stepping technique more closely, but now let's look at how he uses the second of the three available ways to express the music, by turning  on his axis<strong>:</strong></p>

      <span class="pictureCaption"> <em>El Chino</em> and Noem&iacute; matching rotational movement to sound. </span></div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Once again, <em>El Chino</em> uses a  simple tool perfectly. His forward step hits right on a  &quot;<em>chung</em>&quot; from the piano, and then he rotates his waist to the left.  As he twists left, the tension in his waist increases along with   the strings of the orchestra. As the strings go higher, the tension in his left rotation increases.  Then he pauses,  the piano goes, &quot;<em>ting</em>&quot;... and he releases the tension. And just as he releases and starts back, Noem&iacute; raises her leg slightly,  and  <em>exactly</em> on the hit of the piano,  she  flicks her foot over his! </p>
    <p>Notice also how <em>El Chino</em>  repeats the rotation on his axis to follow the strings of the orchestra when they repeat notes. The strings run up; he twists left. They play a few more notes; he follows   back to the right. Then, when they play exactly the same notes again,  he follows with  exactly the same move back to the left.  It's like an orchestra conductor  repeating the same motion with his hand from side to side, while the orchestra  repeats  the notes.   Did you see it? Or rather, did you <em>hear</em> it? You need to <em>hear</em> the music, or you can't dance it.  Tango is movement for a reason.  </p>
    <div align="center" class="paragraphHeader style4"> <strong>****</strong></div>
    <p>Now that we're warmed up, let's look at a short series where he combines the two movements. He moves around the floor in different  directions, stepping front, back, and side, while turning on his axis.  Try to listen first, and watch second, as he and Noem&iacute; convert music into physical movement<strong>:</strong>    </p>

      <p>Finally, here's an example of <em>El Chin</em>o and Alej that shows how he moves to  faster music, with a more marked beat<strong>:</strong></p>

      <span class="pictureCaption">Moving a little faster:&nbsp;<em> El Chino</em> and Alejandra  at <em>Sunderland</em>,<br />
      and at &quot;<em>La Noche de las Milongueras&quot;</em> in <em>Sin Rumbo</em> (2003) </span></div>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In the above video,  <em>El Chino</em> is dancing to faster music with the same two tools<strong>:</strong> movements to the  front, back, and side, combined with a little  rotation on his axis.  But he adds smaller quick steps  to mark the sharper, faster  <em>comp&aacute;s</em> of the <em>tango picado</em> and the milonga music. The  short, quick steps  hit the  weak beats, which tends  to add small hesitations or bumps to the movement of his and Alej's upper bodies. These sharp, rhythmic movements  wouldn't be appropriate for the softer, smoother music in the first clips&mdash;just as the long pauses from the  first clips wouldn't work well with  this music.  </p>
    <p>Note that in the first  dance, Alej is using  the more traditional tango embrace, with her left hand resting on <em>El Chino's</em> right shoulder. She uses it because it's appropriate for the   formal setting at <em>Sunderland</em>, but in the second one at <em>Sin Rumbo</em>,  she wraps her arm around, with her hand resting on his left shoulder. In <em>Sin Rumbo, </em> the setting and the music are less formal, so she instinctively responds  with a less formal embrace. The  very best  dancers like Noem&iacute; and Alej adjust without thinking  to different partners and different conditions because  they have a natural feel for the culture of tango. </p>
    <div align="center" class="paragraphHeader style4"> <strong>****</strong></div>
    <p>For every dancer on these pages, whether it's Ismael floating and surging  to Laurenz, Pocho hitting tiny <em>traspie</em> steps on a single <em>baldosa</em>,   Ricardo linking 17  step <em>corridas</em> to D'Agostino, or Carlos and Nelida's brilliant <em>vals giros</em>, the concept is exactly the same&mdash;they don't just  step. They are masters of the music who listen, and then move for a reason. This is the big lesson picked up from seven years of dancing next to them, and watching them through the lens of a camera. </p>
    <div align="center" class="paragraphHeader style4"> <strong>****</strong></div>
    <p>Next we'll begin to look at the third mode of musical expression available to couples on the floor of the milonga<strong>:</strong> Up and down movement. </p>
