        <p>Hi Rick, <br />
          <br />
I am reading your article occasionally now for a couple of weeks. And I think  it is very good to explain so detailed what the Tango Argentino is about. I  really like your little stories and it is funny to read some of you  explanations. Since I have seen the nice compliments you got from all over the  world I am not going to repeat them all. <br />
<br />
I am living in Berlin and here we have the same annoying situation you  described from the US. The so-called Tango Nuevo has taken over. There is no  place left where you can dance without using some protecting tools out of  martial arts or American football. Actually I was thinking to go with one of my  dancing partners on one of this &ldquo;milongas&rdquo; wearing ice hockey helmets and knee  and elbow protectors. But I am not sure if this is good for our reputation. So  I choose another way. I'll explain later. </p>
        <p>          So I have to say thank you for the immense work you have done. But I also have  some criticisms. <br />
          <br />
          Actually I was thinking a couple of times to write a comment. But then you  actually mentioned most of the things I wanted to add already. But then I came  to chapter six. Although you kind of excused to use it as an example. I  think it is neither fair nor objective right to put Zotto in one video with the  other couples in chapter 6. I still hope you can see what a big difference  there is between them. If not I do not know if you should continue this site.  This sounds hard but for me it is a real insult to O. Zotto. Since he is not in  a milonga but performing I can see nothing wrong in the dancing. Actually he is  doing all the things you promote on your technique chapter (Although his leg is  slightly bent sometimes as you said to have some more energy). And I am not  sure if you could do one of these movements equally. I am not promoting  something like he dances in a milonga for social dancing but to use it as a bad  example is not right. </p>
        <p>One other  thing that really confuses me is the way you speak about people who do not  dance like the old milongueros in BsAs. That is not because it is arrogant.  Actually I have the same opinion. But it is a totally different story to have such an opinion and mention  it between close friends or to put it in the internet. I am not sure if you  aware what it does to people who have not been in the lucky situation to come  in contact to good instructors. As you said by yourself it takes years to  understand what the old music is about (Although I liked the music actually  before I started with Tango dancing it took nearly seven or eight years before  I realized consciously how much is in there). So I guess there are several  million of persons who on their way who would have to think they are complete  idiots because the are not understanding what it is about. <br />
            <br />
          In the case you write your article only for people who already got what tango  is about this is very good one. But you really think somebody who is in an early stage of Tango will  continue reading your article? I think no. And this is a pity. Because  these people could learn a lot. We have the same situation here in Berlin.  There is for my opinion only one teacher who really knows about Tango. He is a  very good dancer and a good teacher. He is Argentine and since most people here  in Berlin can not even see how good he is he thinks they do not like him and do  not want to learn about Tango. Through this he got a very arrogant attitude and  let everybody feel he thinks they are idiots. But it is actually this attitude  which keeps people away from his school and Salon. This again is a real pity. <br />
  <br />
        For this reason I think you are (like the teacher from Berlin) sometimes a bit  complacent. If you want to reach other people you have to give them a door.  Maybe it is sometimes hard but there is no alternative. (By the way you have  done very well with the video of Naveira and the Milongueros and the  explanation). Especially for young people who did not have had the  opportunities to spend years with the music it is very hard to figure out what  is so special about the  tango you promote. And the situation becomes more complicated through  the social changes in our societies. </p>
        <p>          The way of dancing you  prefer is very conservative and in a way I like it too. But lots of  younger lady dancers does not want to just accompany of all the funny things  the leaders are doing (Very good to see in some of the videos you used in the  article). They want to be an active part. I think that is one of the reasons  why the stage Tango became so popular (Some other reasons you mentioned  already. I agree with your observation but I think it is too simple to see only  these points). <br />
          <br />
          Tango has always changed (Your description was very good for me) and it will  change further. And I think people with a lot of knowledge like you have the  chance to lead this change in a socially acceptable way. That is one of most important  points for me. I think it is not good to tell people off because of their  dancing priorities (There is no point to discuss taste). The only thing one can  do is to make clear that social dancing is only working if everybody stops only  to think about themselves. Since the individual became the most important think  in western living style everybody seems to have the urge to proof how special  he/she is. That is an early educational level of freedom most of us are not  really able to handle. Because it gives you a lot of responsibility if you want  or not. The less strict rule there are the more complicated it gets (Welcome  in Berlin). <br />
          <br />
          I think it makes no sense to abandon a lot of (for many people very attractive)  techniques from the milonga. They will come if we want or not. (Another point  related to this is what you have said about effectiveness of dancing. I really  like this idea. And I think it is very important. But the meaning is of course  a different one for somebody who is 30 or 60 years old. Five or six years ago I went to  milongas and did very exhausting stuff for up to six hours. Since I did sports  all my life it felt not unnatural to me. Since then it has changed a lot. I  came a lot closer to the style you probably would describe as effective. But  for me it began to change when I was listening to the music more carefully and  not because I was too exhausted. But I still use some small elements  from stage tango when I have the impression it suits the music and I do not  bother anybody. Actually I am not even thinking about it. It just happens. So  some people like you would consider me probably as one of the nerds that want  to catch everybody&rsquo;s eyes. <br />
          <br />
          But I could imagine that a lot of rejection towards some techniques from stage  tango has also to do with the physical abilities of the people. The average age  in Milongas in Berlin is between 40 and 50. I am not sure but I think that is a  big difference to BsAs. So lots of people in Bs As milongas would not be able  to do lots of movements since they are 20 or 30 years older and lots of them  are overweight. You might say now &quot;That&rsquo;s not necessary. Because they can  express everything they want&quot;. Probably you are right. But for being  honest I want to dance mainly with good dancers in my age. And lots of them  love it if there are unpredictable and sometimes complicated things to follow  because they want to be challenged in another way a 60 or 70 years old lady  probably would like. <br />
          <br />
          I am still not sure but probably the only way is to make clear that you are  only doing such techniques if you are able to handle them (control, navigation  etc. You explained everything). And here it comes WITHOUT BOTHERING ANYBODY  ELSE Including your dancing partner. Another thing you have to consider is that  people have changed a lot since the old Milongueros you have mentioned learned  to dance. I do not want to insult anybody. I love the videos you are posted and  the very subtle way people move, lead and follow. But the social structure and  the role models in society have changed. It is very natural that young people  often are very ambitious and sometimes they are going far over the point. For  me it&rsquo;s easy to understand (Although I do not like modern dance with Tango  elements) that lots of younger women are very attracted to a dancing style  where the have a much more active part and where they can do spectacular  things. In addition it is not easy for a lady to get good dancers. That&rsquo;s why  lot of them probably unconsciously doing embellishment and leg throwing also  for making themselves interesting to other dancers (Lots of leaders like to  dance with this kind of ladies not because it is nice to dance with them but so  they again are going to be interesting for other ladies (You remember the first  and the fourth reason why you have started dancing. I really liked it). <br />
          <br />
          Although the superficial eye-catching stuff is very annoying (I really had to  practice not to look when they would do another silly jump or six square meter  volcada) the only thing that really bothers me is that the &quot;Tango  Nuevo&quot; dancers need for time of the space every other couple need to dance  and that most of them are not able to dance in dancing direction. But for being  far the worst (most inconsiderate) dancers in Berlin are actually dancers who  try to stay with the milonguero style. They are just very bad dancers who can  not control the direction they would fall in. </p>
        <p>          So what is the solution? I do not know. Do we have to separate in different  milongas? Sounds good. But it is not working (At least outside of Bs As). Since  someone who runs a milonga has to earn money to keep the place they have to  please as many people as possible. So they would start to play strange and  mostly bad modern music and people changing their dancing.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
So the only thing I can do if do not want to stay at home is to dance as nice  as possible to show it can be different. Not that I am a good dancer. But I try  to dance very nicely very close to the music. And most dancers I have danced  with liked it. (One other thing I do occasionally is not to give space when  they would run into me because they urgently have to finish this fantastic  movement they have learned in on of the twenty workshops they have done during  the last two weeks. But I only do it if I can turn my partner out of the way.  So sometimes they realize that there was actually no space to do that. But  actually I hate to do it because I want to have a nice and relaxed atmosphere  for everybody in the milonga.) <br />
  <br />
  Somebody with such profound knowledge and good contact to the source like you  could do much more. But I think if you really want to change something and to reach the people who are  doing probably something which you would not consider as any part of Tango the  first step would be to prove that you understand the situation they are in  (You mentioned something like that. But if it is followed by some very bad  definitions about what they do it is not working). Sometimes I have the impression that since you are  so much into Tango you are probably not always aware about your (first of all  mental) stage you have been in before you met the very important people in your  Tango live. First of all your obviously wonderful wife.<br />
  <br />
  Actually I wanted to send a very short comment. But I could not stop. I really  like your work and there have been some very valuable information for me. I am  just thinking all the time how could one change this silly situation in the  milongas in Berlin. And I think your site could be one of the keys. I already  sent it to all the tango people I know. So I did not wanted to tell you how you  have to do things. I am sure you know. It is just suggestions. <br />
  <br />
  Thank you again for your free accessible work. I have to excuse my English. I  hope you could understand what I wrote. <br />
  <br />
  Ps. One technical question:<br />
  On <a href="chapt_6school/14walking5.htm#slide">page 14 in chapter six</a>, you perform nice stepping.  After your feet contact the ground exactly with the <span class="style15">comp&aacute;s</span> there is this  sliding effect. Is your partner suppose to do the same effect when you dance  together? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;-) 
          <br />
          <br />
          Wish you the best and nice regards to Alej although I do not know her (I really  like her comments) <br />
