    <p class="paragraphHeader">Tango  Navigation (Part II) <br />
      The Entire Floor </p>
    <p>Tango navigation is a complicated subject, but two simple things could solve almost all of the  problems on the  floor. On the last page we saw how the <em>ronda</em> can work efficiently if couples center  themselves between the dancers ahead and behind. The secret is to use all of the available space in the right way. Couples should use the entire width of the <em>ronda</em> by dancing  right up against the  tables, and even out toward the center of the floor when space is available (more on that later). They can also  dance up near  the couple in front, and back near  the couple behind&mdash;but then they  always<em> </em>need to find their  way back to  the center. Now let's apply the same concept to the rest of the floor. </p>
    <p class="paragraphHeader">Photoshop Milonga <br />
    <span class="style17">(or... Too Much Time on My Hands)</span></p>
    <p>I sit around and complain so much about the way people navigate  that Alej finally got tired and told me,  &quot;If it bothers you so much, stop complaining, and start your own milonga.&quot; So I did!   I made a floor,  and stuck in some tables. Then, because I'm a basketball fan, I decided to paint it like a basketball court. I painted in lanes for the <em>ronda</em>, with directional arrows, and I painted our sponsor's logo in the middle of the court. Finally, I added a couple of referees in stripped shirts, to keep people in line<strong>: </strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

        My milonga, with lanes, arrows, two referees, and our sponsor's logo painted mid-court. <br />
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Hope you like the blue tablecloths&mdash;I picked them out myself. Now, let's   randomly paste some  dancers around the floor. Some parts of the floor will be crowded, with dancers    clustered  together, and other parts   will be relatively empty. In other words, a typical, messy milonga<strong>: </strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <div align="center">
      <p class="pictureCaption"><img src="6_pics/stick_man/nav13.jpg" width="700" height="400" vspace="5" /><br />
        Why does this pattern occur  all the time in milongas? <br />
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It's time for the  referee to blow his whistle to stop the action! The music  stops, and  he gives everyone a warning<strong>:</strong> &quot;Move away from the couple nearest you. If you see empty space, move toward it. Okay... dance!&quot; They all  follow his instructions, and as they dance, everyone takes a step or two away from the couple nearest to them. They drift into  open space,  and adjust  themselves so that they are  about equally distant  from  the  nearest couples. Then they continue  dancing, following the arrows, and drifting slowly  around the floor<strong>. </strong>Just like basketball players, after a few whistles, they learn not to dawdle, or push up against other people, and the floor starts to look like this<strong>: </strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <div align="center">
      <p class="pictureCaption"><img src="6_pics/stick_man/nav14.jpg" width="700" height="400" vspace="5" /><br />
        The problem  can be fixed by two  simple,  intuitive rules:&nbsp; When you dance, move into empty space,<br /> 
        and  drift away from the couple nearest you.  <br />
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Now this is a milonga you can dance in! All it took to  was for me to select the couples with my mouse that were jammed up, and slide them  a step or two  away from the dancers closest to them. I only had to move about half the couples, and I didn't move them far. It was incredibly simple. In the previous image, many of the couples are boxed in, or trying to dance with people right up next to them. But the people in the second picture have a real chance to express the music! If they plan ahead, they can even take a few large steps when they feel like it. </p>
    <p>In my milonga, citations would be issued for running into other people. Couples with two tickets would have to attend counseling. Repeat offenders would be required to wear special collars which administer a harmless electrical shock whenever they dawdle too long in one spot, or push up against other couples. </p>
    <p class="paragraphHeader">Insiders  </p>
    <p>When it's crowded, another lane usually forms inside the one nearest the tables. In a square  <em>pista</em>, there's often enough room for some couples to dance in the middle. On a rectangular floor,  couples   in the inner <em>ronda</em> that are moving in opposite directions sometimes end up passing close to each other, like cars approaching  on a two lane highway (second image, below).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <div align="center">
      <p class="pictureCaption"><img src="6_pics/photos/nav15b.jpg" width="333" height="333" hspace="30" vspace="8" /><img src="6_pics/photos/nav15c.jpg" width="250" height="438" hspace="30" vspace="8" /><br />
        Square rooms (left) often have space for couples to dance in the middle. Rectangular floors (right) sometimes<br />
        create a situation where couples pass each other from opposite directions (red area).
        <br />
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The inner <em>ronda</em> is often more chaotic than the outer <em>ronda.</em> Couples  move in and out of it, and  pass through it into the center. Obviously you need to be alert  when the lanes pass from opposite directions (red area). I'm sure most people already know all this&mdash;but  certainly not everybody. Even  in the best  milongas, there are  often people who don't follow the flow of the floor. Some are newcomers, and others just don't  pay much attention. But there's another group that intentionally violates the <em>codigos</em>.  On the next page, we'll look at an example of how a couple can use  &quot;dawdling&quot;, &quot;pushing&quot;,  and even kicking, to take away space from other dancers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></em><em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
