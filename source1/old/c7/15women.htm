      <p>Five things for women to avoid:</p>     
     <blockquote>
       <p>1. Don&rsquo;t wiggle your hips when you walk.&nbsp;The man will feel it, and it will throw him off the music.&nbsp;This is a popular fad some places, but it doesn&rsquo;t look good in Buenos Aires, and everybody will notice it.<br />
         <br />
         2. Don&rsquo;t bend or flex at the waist.&nbsp;It causes the same problems as hip wiggling, but it&rsquo;s not even a fad.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s just bad technique.&nbsp;<br />
         <br />
         3. Don&rsquo;t dance with the legs bent.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s inelegant, and when it&rsquo;s combined with flexing at the waist and hip wiggling, it will make the leader feel like he&rsquo;s driving an old car with worn out shocks.&nbsp;Be a Ferrari, not an &lsquo;81 Oldsmobile.&nbsp;<br />
         <br />
         4. Milongueros sometimes pause to allow time for the woman to do adornments&hellip; but don&rsquo;t overdo it.&nbsp;Excessive adornments are sometimes called &ldquo;<em>verduras</em>&rdquo;.&nbsp;Verdura means &ldquo;vegetable&rdquo;, and lots of <em>boleos</em>, kicks, and ankle movements interfere with the music.&nbsp;They also <em>llaman la atenci&oacute;n</em>.&nbsp;But it&rsquo;s not the kind of attention you want. </p>
       <p>5. Finally, don&rsquo;t ever, <em>ever</em> step out of the <em>comp&aacute;s </em>of the music.&nbsp;The man should <em>marcar</em> (lead) the cadence clearly, but at times it&rsquo;s up to the woman to find the rhythm. Nothing is more annoying than a follower who steps out of the <em>comp&aacute;s</em> during a <em>giro</em>.&nbsp;Being out of the music is unforgivable in the milongas.</p>

     <p>The quotes above are from  colleagues  of  the greatest designer of typeface in the world.&nbsp;His name is Matthew Carter, and he learned his trade traditionally by studying old manuscripts from monasteries, and by carving wooden letters by hand.&nbsp;He designed the typeface being used on this page, and many others as well, including the masthead of the New York Times.&nbsp;It struck me that if you substitute &ldquo;tango&rdquo; for &ldquo;typeface&rdquo; in the quotes above, you have an  excellent description of the way the best women dance in Buenos Aires.&nbsp; <br />

                 Just as with<br /> 
               the best milongueros, the best women dancers instinctively gravitate toward  almost identical<br />
               positions on the floor of the milonga.&nbsp;This is the meaning of &ldquo;form follows function&rdquo;. <br />
           </span></div>

     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>The result of good technique is visual and tactile.&nbsp;Others will see it, and your partner will feel it.&nbsp;Bad tango comes from small shortcuts.&nbsp;A slight sagging of the posture, or failure to have discipline with the feet makes everything run together.&nbsp;Each beat should be marked clearly by a sharp step onto a straight leg, and the ankles should brush together with every step to create a brief moment of balance, before tipping off into the next step.&nbsp;Hit the beat precisely.&nbsp;Take no shortcuts.&nbsp;A step back and to the side should be:&nbsp;step back, collect the feet together, slow for a microsecond, and then step to the side.&nbsp;     </p>
     <p>The best milongueras limit their adornments to a few small circles with the foot, or an occasional light toe tap.&nbsp;There are no &ldquo;elaborate features to catch attention.&rdquo; They know how to resist the &ldquo;natural preference for whatever looks difficult&hellip; everything is carefully executed&hellip; with a reservation to its style&rdquo;.&nbsp;Each incremental step is executed with care and feeling, and the aggregate result is that: </p>
