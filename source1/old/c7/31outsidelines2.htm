    <p>On this page we'll continue looking at ways of dancing that are outside the boundaries of social tango, and we'll try to identify some common techniques that don't work well in milongas.  On the last page we looked at how  Copes used leg bend to add  drama to his performance. Now let's look at someone else with a unique way of stepping<strong>:</strong> </p>

      <span class="pictureCaption">Orlando Paiva in 2005.</span></div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>What's the matter with these guys... don't they  understand English? Haven't they read this chapter? I just listed the  basic elements of technique  on page 19, and they're flaunting them.  First, Copes is walking all over the place with his knees bent,  and now here's Orlando Paiva   stepping with  his weight back, and reaching   out with his leg. </p>
    <p>Instead of tipping forward and landing solidly  with his weight forward, notice how Paiva keeps  his chest back, slides his foot out, and then gives a little push with  his back leg to rise up into the step. It's the   opposite of the heavy, chest-forward tango step  we've been describing for use in  milongas.  In our step, the upper body tips forward early, gains momentum  to   the point of foot contact, and then  slows as it uses the energy from the first part of the step to coast  back up to the heel together position. But  Paiva  begins slowly by sliding his foot forward,  and then  he pushes off his back leg to finish. This causes him to    speed up a little as he rises at the end. He still steps on the <em>comp&aacute;s</em>, and he comes up onto a straight leg to the heel-together position, but by beginning slowly, and speeding up at the end,  he expresses the music in a different way.  </p>
    <p>As you would expect, this  basic change  in his center of balance  affects  everything.  When your chest isn't forward, there is less space for your partner's feet to move inside the embrace. Another way to look at it is that if the chest is  back, then as far as your partner is concerned, your legs and  feet are farther forward, taking up her space.  This poses a real problem for straight ahead, in-line walking. If the man's chest is back, and his legs are reaching out forward, his thighs     may actually bump against the woman if she's walking back, directly in front of him.  Paiva  avoids this problem by keeping his partner to the side of his chest, and always walking  along  her  right side. This works okay  for the  melodic string music that many  performers  prefer, but as soon as you begin to step on the consecutive weak and strong beats of faster music, there are problems. If the woman is to the side,  it's difficult  to  transmit the kind of straight-ahead energy    needed for <em>corridas</em>. </p>
    <p>Doing <em>corridas</em> (runs of consecutive steps), and curving them in different ways, is a big part of dancing in the milongas, but if the woman is parked out to the side, the man will tend to run past her. In fact, if you look closely, you'll see that she's positioned so that  it's impossible for her to   step straight back. She's at an angle, and when Paiva walks forward, she actually needs to walk back a little sideways, with her torso twisted.   (We noticed this problem several years ago when we examined <em>Petroleo's</em> dancing and embrace in Chapter 3. Because <em>Petroleo's</em> partner  in the video stayed on his right side,  she often ended up  dancing sideways when he moved forward quickly.  There was no problem when they moved slowly, but she had trouble keeping up  when he accelerated.) </p>
    <p>Another  problem with this chest back posture is that whenever  Paiva and his partner need to step inside the embrace,  they're forced to separate. A <em>giro</em>, for example, which requires the woman to step  between the partners, forces them to open the embrace and  create some space between them<strong>:</strong> </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You may also notice that Paiva's weight is so far back that he isn't grounded enough  to actually lead his partner in the <em>giro</em>&mdash;and  she even  needs to  pull him through part of it!  She's obviously practiced  it for the  performance, but  it's not something that would  work in  a milonga with different  partners. </p>
    <p>This weight-back posture seems to be part of the traditions of stage tango.  Virulazo was another famous performer who danced with his weight back. And he  also did a  highly decorated, partner-assisted <em>giro</em><strong>:</strong> </p>

    <p> Paiva has his own style, and it works well with the slower instrumental tangos that are often used in performances. But there are good reasons that it isn't commonly used in the milongas. First, beginning a step  by reaching out with the leg, rather than tipping forward with the upper body, delays  the signal the man sends to  his partner. She receives the message later, and has less time to react.    This isn't  normally a problem in a performance&mdash;but it can be in a milonga. Second, tipping into the beginning of a step is simply  easier than pushing off the back leg all night long. Third, keeping the weight and chest forward allows the woman to stay more in front of the man, so she can more easily follow him through the fast steps of  <em>corridas</em>. And finally,  dancing with the weight forward allows the couple to maintain the embrace throughout the entire dance, without having to separate every time they want to  step inside the embrace, or do a <em>giro</em>. </p>
    <div align="center" class="paragraphHeader style4"><strong>****</strong></div>
    <p>This video of Orlando Paiva was taken about a year before he died, and it's very nice. He's obviously not that strong,  but the balance and the skill are  still there. Just as with Copes, I spent some  time trying to copy Paiva&mdash;but it wasn't planned. Around the time  I first became interested in tango, I went  to  visit my cousin in Los Angeles. One evening I noticed a practica advertised nearby,  so I decided to go. When I arrived,  the only person there was the organizer.  She was an Argentine woman, who was  teaching with Paiva   at the time. Since there was no one else at the practica, she spent the whole time  dancing with me and showing me how he stepped. She had me  stand with my weight and chest back, reach gracefully forward with my toe, and then  give a little push with my trailing leg to bring my weight forward and up, just like Paiva is doing here.   I thought it felt, and looked, pretty sharp. It wasn't that hard to pick up, and it had a very slow, relaxed feel that I liked.  </p>
    <p>When I left, I felt  bad because I'd only paid about five dollars, and ended up with  private instruction from an Argentine woman who obviously knew what she was talking about. It was a hundred times better than anything I was getting from other  instructors. All they ever did was walk  around in circles and  demonstrate patterns they had memorized, so I bought a video from her.  It was an instructional video with her and Paiva, but I seem to have lost it. I looked for it  when I wrote this page, but I guess it's gone. I liked her, because she actually taught the mechanics of movement.  You have to be smart to do that&mdash;I've run across very few people in tango,  who can. Miguel Zotto's old partner Milena Plebs (who teaches a step similar to the one the lady showed me), and Natu (who is an engineer), are two that  come to mind.  </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This is from one of the first instructional videos I ever bought. Even then, I noticed  that   Pablo moved  differently. Can you see it?  He's   using leg bend to dampen out  almost all of the natural up and down movement in his walk.   He  begins   with a long reaching step  onto  a straight leg. If he then continued forward with the knee  locked,  he would rise up, and then drop back down at the finish&mdash;but he doesn't. As soon as his foot strikes the floor, he immediately starts to flex his leg to absorb the  rise. When he reaches  the heel-to-heel position, he has quite a bit of bend in his knees, and then  he  straightens his legs   to  finish the step.  It's an effect that causes his upper body to  move along smoothly on a level plain.  Not only does this way of stepping eliminate most of the up and down movement from his dancing, but it also removes  the   forward acceleration and deceleration that occurs in the more straight-legged walk we looked at earlier in the chapter. </p>
    <p>Copes  also uses leg bend to stay at the same level as he moves forward, but he usually begins by stepping onto a bent leg, so it looks like he&rsquo;s crouching down as he walks. Pablo, on the other hand,  reaches out onto a straight leg before he flexes his knee. He starts and finishes on a straight leg,  so the result is more liquid. It's like a  cat reaching out  to the front as it stalks its prey.  What do you think about it? This step, and its variations, must be pretty attractive, because they are currently in fashion with many of the younger generation of nuevo-show dancers. </p>
    <p>Here's more of the performance, with music<strong>:</strong></p>

    <p>Good dancers. Esther's feet   have the speed of a young professional dancer, and also the  control that  comes from years of  experience. She has the   natural body of a woman her age, and the beautiful  way of moving that you see in some of the  best Argentine women    who've been dancing tango forever. So much dignity...  and even   a touch of arrogance.  She looks like royalty. If Argentina ever decides to change their government  and go with a queen, they should ask her if she wants the job. Or at least they should find  someone who dances tango like she does. </p>

    <p> They're definitely messing with the traditions of tango&mdash;but if you're going  to mess around,    then that's the way to do it. It's unorthodox, but they pull it off because it's original,  their technique is excellent, and most importantly, it's a  good  interpretation of that small segment of music. It's nice to discover this hidden away in plain sight in this old  tape. Who knows where the idea for that little part   came from? Maybe they just did it a couple of times, and then forgot about it.  If I had to guess, I'd say  the idea  came from someone who has heard  and danced to this bit of Di Sarli  about a thousand times.  So maybe  Mingo or Esther put it in because Pablo was  pushing them to try new things. Or maybe they just wanted to keep their son interested in tango. </p>
    <p>When I ordered this tape,  it came in the mail along with several others. I hadn't looked at  them in years, but the bit of music in the video above reminded me of something  on another one of the tapes. It's Tete dancing to the same music, so I thought it might be fun to look at what Tete does with the same little <em>staccato</em> part of Di Sarli's  <em>Pollo Ricardo</em>. (That name... <em>Pollo Ricardo!</em> &nbsp;Only in tango.)&nbsp; In a way, this is   like the comparison of Copes and Buglione that we did on the last page. It's not exactly fair to compare a performance  to spontaneous  social dancing, but let's  do it anyway, and see what we get<strong>:</strong> </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Not bad. Tete is rougher&mdash;but he's definitely listening! In the  first part of the video, you can see how  he  picks up on the    same jerkiness of Di Sarli's orchestra, and marks it  intuitively by bringing his feet together in several  little stomps and freezes. It's may not  be quite as entertaining as      Esther and Pablo's choreographed response, but it's there. </p>
    <div align="center" class="paragraphHeader style4"><strong>****</strong></div>
    <p>While we have them  here on the same page, it might be a good opportunity to compare the difference between   Paiva's traditional stage  tango  and Tete's  social tango. Paiva  has the  smooth, weight-back way of moving and  the  open embrace of  many performers, while  Tete uses the more   &quot;step-into-the-floor and  mark  the<em> comp&aacute;s&quot;</em> style of the crowded milongas. A classic example of sophisticated show tango vs.  the working class tango of the street.</p>
    <p>It's also interesting to note how much diversity there is in the dancing on this  page. I remember a question in the &quot;Comments Section&quot; about how you should dance in different ways to different orchestras.  My answer was that I thought there were too many variations in the music to associate certain ways of dancing with a specific orchestra&mdash;and this   is a good example of it. There are six accomplished  tango dancers here, and  it's easy to see that each one is dancing in ways that are  noticeably different from the all the others. It's as if each one is doing a completely different  dance&mdash;and yet they're all dancing  to the same orchestra. And four of them are dancing to the exact same tango!</p>
