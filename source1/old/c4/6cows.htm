   <p align="left">There was a time when there was a lot of  criticism of D&rsquo;Arienzo. He wasn't like some of the other  more sophisticated tango musicians of his day. His critics   said his music was simple, and he played too fast. He  put the <em>comp&aacute;s</em> right up in your face, and he jumped around on the stage like a wild man.&nbsp;Some of his critics might have used the phrase &ldquo;pop tango&rdquo;&hellip; if it had existed back then.&nbsp;But we do know he filled up the milongas, and he caused a huge tango boom that made it possible for other great orchestras to thrive and create.&nbsp;Is he playing tango at an inferior level?&nbsp;Here is some classic D&rsquo;Arienzo:</p>

  <p align="left">What a name for a tango.&nbsp;<em>El Cencerro</em>&hellip; &ldquo;The Cowbell&rdquo;.&nbsp;As near as I can tell, it&rsquo;s about cows walking.&nbsp;Well, we have a rule that says tango should be unpretentious, and this one certainly qualifies.&nbsp;Although this music may lack the polish of Pugliese, the intimidating talent of Troilo, or the innovation of Piazzolla, it contains genius.&nbsp;<em>Cencerro</em> is an incredibly effective tango that does exactly what it is meant to do.&nbsp;The beginning isn&rsquo;t too promising.&nbsp;It has a sort of &ldquo;Yep, here we are plodding along a path in the <em>Pampas</em>&rdquo; feel to it.&nbsp;But then it gets interesting.&nbsp;The cadence begins to build&hellip; and build&hellip; and finally&hellip; <em>wow!</em>&nbsp;D&rsquo;Arienzo uses a relentless <em>comp&aacute;s</em> that ebbs and flows, ebbs and flows, and finally creates an almost unbearable intensity&hellip; or at least it should for a tango dancer.&nbsp;In fact, it may contain the most intense minute of driving, pounding bandoneons in all of tango.&nbsp;D&rsquo;Arienzo&rsquo;s bandoneons almost induce  a hypnotic state; an opportunity for dancing that is unequaled.</p>
  <p align="left"> I've seen milongueros  jump right out of their chairs  when they hear the start of this tango. (There is a similar part in a Biaggi vals that we&rsquo;ll discuss later.)&nbsp;Listen to how the solo bandoneon comes in and plays around the <em>comp&aacute;s</em> at 1:15, and then the strings join at 1:45.&nbsp;First, the bandoneon melody comes in, but still the <em>STRONG-weak, STRONG-weak, STRONG-weak</em> continues.&nbsp;The cows keep walking.&nbsp;Then he brings in strings from way up high, and wraps them around the bandoneons&hellip; and the cows still keep walking.&nbsp;I dance this tango waiting for the moment with the strings at 1:45.&nbsp;The momentum that builds to this point is so intense that the ending is almost a disappointment&mdash;although D&rsquo;Arienzo finishes with a place for very quick, sharp footwork at the end&mdash;if we aren&rsquo;t too spent to use it.</p>
  <p align="left"> Here&rsquo;s another one by D&rsquo;Arienzo.&nbsp;This is&nbsp;a vals with the unforgettable name of &ldquo;Tears and Smiles&rdquo;.&nbsp;The vals comp&aacute;s is <em>STRONG-weak-weak, STRONG-weak-weak</em>.&nbsp;Listen to how D&rsquo;Arienzo pauses, and begins again, and how he changes the music toward the end:&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is a <em>vals</em> that immediately reveals who knows how to dance.&nbsp;The <em>vals</em> comp&aacute;s of <em>Lagrimas</em> is clear, the pauses are clear, and the changes of intensity are clear.&nbsp;Even a beginner should be able to hear them.&nbsp;In one sense, the music is simple&mdash;but it also allows the most advanced dancers to stretch themselves.&nbsp;Listen to the pauses at 2:20 and 2:27, and note the important change in the music at 2:40.&nbsp;You really must be able to follow the orchestra in this one, and if you can&rsquo;t go from quick <em>vals giros</em>, into and out of smooth, balanced pauses on a crowded floor, you&rsquo;ll be outed.&nbsp; <em>Cencerro</em> requires the ability to dance in at least two different ways; and <em>Lagrimas</em>, probably three.&nbsp;For <em>Cencerro</em>, at a minimum, you must be able to walk well, and perform <em>corriditas</em>&mdash;short runs with varied cadences.&nbsp;The parts where the bandoneon and strings come in (at 1:15 and 1:45) call for the ability to make fast linked <em>giros</em>, also with varied cadences and with varied turning speeds: hesitate-spin-hesitate-spin.&nbsp;Finally, the quick bandoneon at the end gives the opportunity for other types of quick footwork.</p>
  <p> Some tangos create emotion with words and intonations of the singer&rsquo;s voice.&nbsp;Others use melody and the interplay of instruments in the orchestra.&nbsp;The best, like Troilo&rsquo;s <em>Farol</em> combine all three.&nbsp;But in <em>Cencerro</em>, D&rsquo;Arienzo uses the intensity of the <em>comp&aacute;s</em> to grab listeners&mdash;or maybe I should say dancers.&nbsp;His rhythms create a hypnotic effect that can be almost primitive in the way it sweeps people up  and takes over the milonga.&nbsp;Listen again to the part that begins at  1:15&mdash;a full minute of pure and intense <em>dos por cuatro</em>.&nbsp;I used to think of a steam locomotive during this part, but after I learned the name of the tango, the image changed to cows walking relentlessly across the prairie.&nbsp;Now, I see D&rsquo;Arienzo himself in those old 1950s kinescopes taken from television&mdash;he's right up into the front row of the bandoneons, crouching low and using all  his body; moving from one to the other as the energy builds,  his face right into them&mdash;and then suddenly he jumps up and laughs wildly, like his own rhythm has driven him crazy. </p>
  <p>When you really have it down, a tanda of this music can induce the kind of flowing athletic trance that feels almost like fast skiing or windsurfing.&nbsp; All of this seems like a pretty good thing&mdash;so why was there so much animosity toward this music by some people? To understand that, let's take a quick look at what was happening in tango before D&rsquo;Arienzo became so wildly popular.&nbsp; </p>
