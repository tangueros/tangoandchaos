  <font color="#000000" size="-1">&quot;End of the Affair&quot;</font></p>
  <p>This is one of the greatest of the great Castillo <em>valses</em>. I remember  some  milongueros   singing along with it at a party a few years ago, and  Miguel Balbi, who  sings tango in  clubs, kept repeating the last line<strong>: </strong><em>&quot;No hay NADA entre nosotros... ANDATE por favor!&quot; </em></p>
  <p> They were trying to match the sharpness and emotion of Castillo's voice,  and they kept shaking their heads and laughing at how  difficult it was.  The words are about a man who  has absolutely reached his limit with a woman. He  doesn't pull any punches, and his message  is clear:&nbsp; &quot;I'm finished with you... understand?   I'm sick of your games. You've hurt me for the last time, so... <em> get  out of here!!&quot;</em></p>
  <p>Ernesto Delgado and Miguelito  kept marveling  at the difficulty of staying with  Castillo, and also chuckling at the  half funny, half tragic lyrics. I mean, it is tragic&mdash;but then,  most of us have been there&mdash;and we lived through it. So from the distance of a few years,  it's possible to see a touch  of humor in the way Castillo hammers out that last line<strong>:</strong></p>

  <p><em>&quot;Andate&quot; </em>is a strong word in <em>castellano</em>. In Argentina, you would  normally say,  &quot;<em>Deber&iacute;as irte&quot;&nbsp; </em>(&quot;You should   go&quot;)<em>. Andate </em>is  like saying, <em>&quot;Beat it!&quot;</em> or <em>&quot;Hit the road!&quot;</em> &nbsp;It's something you might yell at  a dog trespassing in your yard.</p>
  <p>Like all the great tango singers, Castillo is  also an actor. He begins relatively calmly, but as he tells his story, he begins to get worked up. The &quot;<em>Andate</em>&quot; at the beginning  is noticeably different from the one at the end, as he  moves from indignation, into something approaching   rage. I really love the energy and passion in this <em>vals. </em>Castillo is   a fantastic singer. We know a good milonguero (Gerardo Quiroz) who will only dance to <em>valses </em>if they're sung by Castillo. </p>
  <p>After watching Miguel and Ernesto,  I've tried to sing along with   Castillo and Echag&uuml;e to some of the fast tangos.  I'm neither a singer, nor a native speaker,  so it's just for fun&mdash;but it's still an interesting exercise. If you  try it,  you'll  get some idea of how difficult it is to sing tango. I'm not able to make may  mouth move fast enough to keep up with the music, and Castillo's cadences are very complicated. I still can't figure out how he manages to squeeze in all the words at the end of this <em>vals</em> and still  finish with the orchestra. </p>
  <p>For me, great <em>valses</em> like  this one are at the very pinnacle of tango dancing. Listen to the totality of  the music, and the way Castillo's voice soars and plays around  the cadence. This one has   about  80 strong beats per minute, with  two weak  beats squeezed in between. It's    super fast, but it&rsquo;s not <em>staccato </em>(it  doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of sharp,  distinct notes). Like most of the best <em>valses</em>, the cadence is fast and clear, but  everything  still flows  forward smoothly...  so there&rsquo;s really only one  way to express it<strong>:</strong> Your body needs to  keep moving and turning, while your feet express the <em>comp&aacute;s</em>  by hitting some of the very fast weak beats. </p>
  <p>We'll discuss this a lot more and give examples in Chapters 5 &amp; 6, but for now, the thing to remember is that    the &ldquo;park and perform&rdquo; tango they sell in workshops  has nothing to do with this music.  This <em>vals</em> is a round hole&mdash;and stunts   like  <em>volcadas </em>and    <em>sacadas </em>are square pegs. They won't fit.  </p>
