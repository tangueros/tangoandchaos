  <p><em><img src="4_pics/recova.jpg" width="162" height="250" class="floatLeft" /></em>From 1935 to 1945 tango grew and changed in ways it never had before&mdash;and never would again. Great poets sat  in the <em>confiterias</em> writing lyrics, and the orchestras were playing to packed milongas every night. Tango owned the city, and the    incredible creativity and energy in the air  must have inspired everyone.  There&rsquo;s a lot of speculation about when and where tango was born, but I think the answer is easy. While the rest of the world was tearing itself apart with war, tango was being born in Buenos Aires. It all  comes from those ten years. The most golden time of the Golden Age.</p>
  <p>We just listened to a couple of tangos from 1938, so let&rsquo;s jump ahead to 1944 and see what&rsquo;s new. The tango is <em>Amarras</em>. An <em>amarra</em> is a mooring line used to tie a ship to the dock (or maybe in this case, a tree on the bank of the <em>Riachuelo</em>). The guy in this tango has a <em>lancha carbonera</em>; a boat that he uses to transport coal up the <em>Riachuelo,</em> into the heart of tango.  </p>
  <p>But the action in this tango takes place in a <em>recova</em>. A <em>recova</em> is  a sidewalk with the floor of a building extending over the top of it, and arches opening onto the street. <em>Recovas</em> are part of the Spanish Colonial architecture of America, and they still exist in the older parts of BsAs around  markets and government buildings&mdash;which is good, because it gives our boatman some gloomy shadows to wander around in as he deals with... what else? Woman trouble<strong>:</strong></p>

    <p>This is one of a handful of tangos that I got addicted to when I first began dancing. I picked up  some of the lyrics, and now I can't walk into a <em>recova</em> without  humming it. &quot;<em>Vago, como  sombra tormentada... bajo el gris de la recova...&quot; </em>&nbsp;We used to dance to it all the time, but then it seemed to go away. Maybe Alej and I started going to places that didn&rsquo;t play it as much, but writing this page has brought it all back. I had to listen to it about 30 times to get  the words right, and now I'm re-addicted. I found that just like Gardel, Maur&eacute; gets better every time he sings it. And that   D'Arienzo violin  gets better, too. <a name="dancenote" id="dancenote"></a></p>

        <div align="center">Dancing Tip </div>
      </div>
      <p>If you like <em>Amarras</em>, there's nothing wrong with standing up next to your computer and moving around. Dancing by yourself is a great way to get in touch with the music. We'll copy the music control here, in case you want to try it:</p>
      <div align="center" class="musicSmall"><font size="+1"><em>        AMARRAS, D'Arienzo con Maur&eacute;</em></font>
          <object
data="xspf_player_slim.swf?playlist_url=amarras.xspf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="540" height="16">
            <param name="movie" value="xspf_player_slim.swf?playlist_url=amarras.xspf" />
          </object>
          <br />
          <br />
      </div>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p> You don't need space or big movements, and you don't need to worry about a partner. A man or a woman can do it, and it  doesn't matter at all what it looks like.  Do what comes naturally. If you want to swing your arms around a little when Maur&eacute; starts to sing, go for it. You can enjoy D'Arienzo's beautiful introduction by simply changing weight back and forth from one foot to the other<strong>:</strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>S</em><em>tep-step... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;step-step... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;step-quick-step</em>...<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>S</em><em>trong-strong... &nbsp;&nbsp;strong-strong... &nbsp;&nbsp;strong-weak-strong</em>...</p>
      <p>Try to hit a quick <em>1-2-3</em> along with D'Arienzo when he emphasizes something. When Maur&eacute; comes in with the first few lines, add something new. Begin to float and turn. Move  smoothly, like a shadow in the <em>recova</em>. Let the motion  come through your chest, while your upper body drifts and floats. Now, you're a part of the little opera that's taking place&mdash;you've become &quot;nothing&quot;, like the boatman. Drifting weightlessly, carrying your partner along. </p>
      <p>Moving this way is the first step toward having the music inside. Another way to say it is that it adds &quot;musical  symmetry&quot; to your dancing. In Chapter 6 we discuss the importance of biomechanical symmetry in tango.  You need to stay balanced and centered, so you can step the same way with either leg, and move the same way to either side. One side of your body should mirror the other. In musical symmetry, your whole body   mirrors the music. In Chapter 6, there are  some good examples of milongueros using &quot;musical symmetry&quot;. </p>
      <p>We also provide  examples of some well-known performers and teachers dancing <em>asymmetrically</em>.  Musical asymmetry happens when people try to link  patterns and figures together in a milonga. Unless  a dance is carefully  choreographed and rehearsed with a specific tango,  pre-planned steps  inevitably get out of synch with the music. For instance in <em>Amarras</em>, there's a place where both the cadence and melody are repeated: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><em>Yo s&oacute;lo s&eacute; que pen&eacute;...<br />
          que ca&iacute;, y que rode</em></p>
        <p><em>One-two three&hellip; One two three,<br />
          One-two three&hellip; One two three.</em></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Then, it happens again: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><em>Yo s&oacute;lo s&eacute; que tu adi&oacute;s,<br />
          en la burla del dolor,</em></p>
        <p><em>One-two three&hellip; One two three,<br />
          One-two three&hellip; One two three.</em></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>When  dancing to these  repeated phrases in a milonga,  an accomplished stage couple might move smoothly and acrobatically right through the first phrase, and continue their figure partway into the second. But then,  they'd  have to pause, and pick up the music again. Most audiences and people new to tango music wouldn't even notice it, but for milongueros this kind of dancing sticks out. It's like an off-key instrument  in the orchestra. Or sometimes worse&mdash;like chalk screeching on a blackboard. </p>
    </div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><br />
      This tango is pronounced<em> am<span class="style23">&aacute;</span>rrras</em>s, and it contains one of my favorite <em>castellano</em> words<strong>:</strong> <em>&quot;vago</em>&quot;. We don't have it in English, but I'm sure it's related to &quot;vagabond&quot;&mdash;except  it's  a verb. It  means to wander around aimlessly. Like<em> trasnochar </em>(to be out all night), <em>vagar</em> is a great <em>castellano</em>-tango  word that we could put to good use in English. </p>
    <p>Do you hear any differences between  D&rsquo;Arienzo here, and his earlier tangos  on the last page? Did his music &ldquo;grow&rdquo;? Did it get better? Obviously, computers, medicine, and airplanes keep getting better and better&mdash;but what about music? What about art? Does art progress, or does it just change? Hard to say. But for better or worse, I think D'Arienzo has picked up  a little  De Caro, because the music has a   smoother,  fuller, more orchestral sound, and a little less of the  jumpy street sound it had earlier. He may have also  picked up some of what Troilo was doing, because there are more lyrics,  and they seem to fit into the music better. They  tell a more complete  story. </p>
    <p>But I think the biggest difference is in Maur&eacute;&rsquo;s voice. It sounds like he moved away from the nasal  voice of the <em>arrabal</em>.  (In &ldquo;<em>El Bulin de la Calle Ayucucho</em>&rdquo;,  this is called a &ldquo;<em>voz gangoza</em>&rdquo;.) His later voice sounds deeper; more from  the chest. Maur&eacute; hung around with boxers, and his voice  has the sort of masculine sound you&rsquo;d expect from a heavyweight fighter&mdash;although to an Argentine of that day, the higher pitched <em>arrabalero</em> of Castillo might have sounded like it came from   a tougher neighborhood. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="tipBox">
      <div class="style24">
        <div align="center">Identification Tip: Biaggi </div>
      </div>
      <p>How about the piano. Do you hear Biaggi? It sounds   like him&mdash;but it can't be, because D'Arienzo fired him in 1938! (<a href="../comments_updates_new.htm#biaggi">See note.</a>) I'm sure D'Arienzo liked Biaggi's sound, and he may have decided to hire  someone  to  replicate it. But is it the same? Here are two examples of Biaggi playing with his own orchestra after he left D'Arienzo. They're from about the same time that <em>Amarras</em> was recorded<strong>:</strong></p>
      <div align="center" class="musicSmall"><font size="+1"><em>BIAGGI, piano <br />
        </em></font>
          <object
data="xspf_player_slim.swf?playlist_url=Biaggimix.xspf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="540" height="16">
            <param name="movie" value="xspf_player_slim.swf?playlist_url=aBiaggimix
		  .xspf" />
          </object>
          <br />
          <br />
      </div>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The first part is from <em>Gaucho Sentimiento</em>, and Biaggi's  piano has a sharp, silvery sound. Then, the part at the end is from <em>Incendio. </em>In<em> Incendio</em>  it  sounds like he's attacking the piano. It's like he's driving his fingers down  into the keys, and it's so much louder than the rest of the music,  that it almost  sounds distorted&mdash;as if he's about to overload the old recording equipment. </p>
      <p>At first, I thought the piano in <em>Amarra</em>s sounded  like Biaggi, but after listening to these two examples,  I can hear a difference. And I'm sure the difference  would have been even more dramatic when he was playing live in the milongas. It must have been unforgettable&mdash;the sound exploding  straight from  the piano, undistorted by the old recordings we hear today<strong>;</strong> his hands flying<strong>;</strong> attacking the keys&mdash;literally bringing audiences  to their feet. People were staying  on the floor to applaud him after the tandas, until finally, D'Arienzo couldn't take it any more, and got rid of him.  That's why his <em>sobre nombre</em> was <em>Manos Brujas</em>. (&quot;Magic Hands&quot;... &quot;Wizard Hands&quot;.) </p>
      <p>After Biaggi left D'Arienzo, he took rhythmic <em>tango picado</em> to a new level.  The   opportunities  to play with the <em>comp&aacute;s</em> in his tangos are endless, and for a while,  some of his <em>valses</em> were my favorite pieces for dancing. But everything changes. I've become a little older, and more contemplative, and I know more. Some of the Castillo <em>valses</em> have moved up to join them... and of course there's Vargas... and Troilo with Fiorentino, and... well, I guess my list is getting top-heavy. Everything we've discussed so far in this chapter is at the top&mdash;along  with about a hundred other tangos as well. The more I dance, and the more I learn,  the better it  gets. It's  great, isn't it? </p>
