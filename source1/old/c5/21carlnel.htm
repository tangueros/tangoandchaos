    <p>I knew this was going to happen. We have limited server space, and these  videos take forever to download... but I came across this next one  when I was looking for the triple step, and I had to include it.   It doesn't show anything special, except that this Laurenz/Podest&aacute; <em>vals</em> is too  damn beautiful to leave  out. This is really what dancing <em>vals</em> is all about: </p>

      <p>Okay, we can't just put things on here totally for fun. This video actually shows a lot, so to justify the bandwidth, we should have a quick tech discussion (skip it and just enjoy the video if you want). </p>
      <p>Let's ask a question: Why does their dancing look so good? I think there are a lot of reasons. Obviously, without the right posture, step, connection and <em>comp&aacute;s</em> they couldn't even begin to dance this way. But there's a more specific reason. The key to <em>vals</em> is that <em>if</em> you do a quick step, you should hit the <em>first</em> of the two weak beats. The problem most people have is they step between the two weak beats. Or somewhere around the two beats. Can you see the right way to do it here? If you look closely, you'll see that their quick steps seem to come just a little earlier than in tango. It's because they're hitting the first weak. That's what makes <em>vals</em> special, and  that's why   their dancing looks  like <em>vals</em>.</p>
      <p>Finally, note how they use the music. Here's just one example: As the music builds Carlos links two <em>giros, </em>and then exits with a back <em>corrida</em>. He lets the music carry  them into the <em>giros</em>, and he varies the speed of the turn to match the music. Finally, he slows the turn, and  walks out backward in a weaving path, using some of the weak beats as the music fades. There's one place just after the midpoint of the clip where Carlos really catches his stride. It happens just when the slider passes the two small arrows&nbsp; <strong><span class="style2">^</span>--<span class="style2">^&nbsp;</span></strong>under the screen. As they approach the right corner of the floor, they do a double <em>giro</em>, and then Carlos does his weaving back <em>corrida</em> toward the camera. Try blocking out their feet and watch the way their  bodies  flow with the music. And for ladies who are looking for a tango role model, you couldn't do any better than Nelida in this video. Carlos can be difficult to follow, but she makes it look easy. Notice her feet. She's a perfect example of the clean, beautiful style that we discussed in the  section on women's technique in Chapter 3. </p>
      <p>Discovering things like this in a piece of video is the reason I'm so fascinated by the milongueros. I have tremendous respect for them because they're ordinary working people with no training in dancing or music, but they are somehow able to  walk into a dance hall and create something  beautiful that's never been seen before. How do they do it? Who showed Carlos how to  express this <em>vals </em>in such a brilliant way? There's literally no one else in the world that does it. He just invented it! Every time I study a video of the milongueros, I find something unique like this. That's why I think the film is so important. Without film, the things they do will die with them. No one would ever know Carlos and Nelida, or anyone else for that matter, could to do something like this. </p>
      <p>There's a lot more to discuss&mdash;especially some of the subtle  ways  Carlos is interacting with the cadences of Podest&aacute;'s voice. But we can talk about that later. Let's move on.</p>
