    <p>If you&rsquo;re like me, you often feel frustrated about  not getting  to show your stuff in the milongas. I know,  I know... you got the moves, but you just ain&rsquo;t got the room. All those pesky dancers keep getting in the way. Well, I feel your pain. So we're going to show you a few  tricks that are guaranteed to get you  a little &quot;elbow room&quot;. Previously, these techniques  we're only available in expensive workshops and correspondence courses, but now, due to the magic of  electronic computers, we're able to bring them directly into your home or    office (or home-office)  for free. Let's get started.</p>
    
    <p class="paragraphHeader"><span class="style19">Step I: <em>&quot;Be My Bitch&quot;</em></span></p>
    <p>Here's the scenario<strong>:</strong> You are dancing quietly, enjoying the milonga like any other normal, unimaginative couple. But looks  can be deceiving. The people around you are about to get a glimpse of the future&mdash;and for them, <em>&ldquo;Future Shock&rdquo;</em> will no longer   be just the title of some book they were supposed to have read in college. You are about to send them back to school. You are about to reveal a &quot;New Tango&quot;!</p>
    <p>In this tutorial, we'll  keep it simple. We'll  use only five couples on a small floor, and we'll take it one step at a time. We begin with the couples dancing normally, counter-clockwise around  the <em>ronda</em>. You are the red billiard ball in the diagrams below<strong>:</strong> </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <div align="center"><img src="6_pics/stick_man/nav17.jpg" width="220" height="352" hspace="18" vspace="7" /><img src="6_pics/photos/nav18a.jpg" width="220" height="352" hspace="18" vspace="7" /><img src="6_pics/photos/nav44b.jpg" width="220" height="351" hspace="18" vspace="7" /><br />
        <span class="pictureCaption">The opening salvo: Slow down, so that  space  opens up in front of you (left picture). Then,  throw a fast<br />
          U-turn to
    confront the couple behind you (middle picture). Finally,  &quot;hold and intimidate &quot; (right pic). </span></div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The first step   is to begin  lagging (first picture on the left). As you slow down,  couples will begin to back up behind you, and a gap  will open up in front. (This is  the space  you're going to grab.) Now, if you got the eggs (or &quot;<em>Bolivianos</em>&quot; as we say down here in <em>Rioplatense</em>), it's time to fire the first shot. Take a deep breath, do a U-turn,  and go  right at the couple behind you (middle picture).   Get right up in their grill, and let them know you mean business! Bust a pose, and hold it until  they back down (last pic).
    </p>
    <p class="paragraphHeader">Step II: <em>&quot;House of Flying Daggers&quot;</em></p>
   
    <div align="center"><img src="6_pics/photos/nav45w220a.jpg" width="220" height="351" hspace="18" vspace="7" /><img src="6_pics/photos/nav45w220b.jpg" width="220" height="351" hspace="18" vspace="7" /><img src="6_pics/photos/nav45.jpg" width="220" height="351" hspace="18" vspace="7" /><br />
      <span class="pictureCaption">Seek target (fig. 1), &nbsp;launch kick (fig. 2),  &nbsp;retreat and celebrate
    (fig. 3)</span>.</div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Now it&rsquo;s time to deal with the couple in  front of you. The key is to come out of nowhere, like a   Hellfire missile streaking  out of the sky into a terrorist training camp. Go right up to 'em and throw a kick  (left picture). You don't actually have to make contact. A near miss should work&mdash;but they need to feel your power. And when they do, they will run away... and then    it's game over! Now all you have to do is  move to the center of the  secured area (middle picture), and use it (last picture).    You just caught the winning touchdown in the Super Bowl, and it's time to celebrate.  Strut yo' stuff! </p>
    <p>Now, we'll let Gustavo Naveira show you how it  works in the real world. As the scene opens, he has just faced down the couple  behind him. Then, he moves across the floor to deal with the couple  dancing  ahead of him. He backs into them, crowds them into the wall, and then throws a kick that lands  blindly behind him,  inches from their feet. Finally, he goes back across  the floor, and fires  a   warning kick at  the entire room.    By the end of this short clip, he has driven everyone  to the other  side of the dance floor<strong>:</strong><br />

    <p>You can see that Naveira has almost half of the floor to himself. This video demonstrates how you can  use posturing, leg feints,  and &quot;<em>dancing loco</em>&quot; to  drive away other dancers. It's like biting  the head off of a live chicken. You'll get everyone's  attention, and they'll  give you plenty of room. <a name="interview" id="interview"></a></p>

          3,000 Years of Naveira and Salas    </div>
      </div>
      <p align="left">      After looking at the odd things Naveira was doing, I began to wonder what was going on inside his head.  So I looked on the  Internet, and I discovered a couple of interviews where he and his partner  Fabian Salas discuss tango. They are amazing pieces of work. At times they  approach the nuttiness of the &ldquo;<em>Our amps go to eleven</em>&rdquo; interview in <em>Spinal  Tap</em>. Here are some of the highlights<strong>:</strong> </p>
      <p>From the very beginning, Naveira and Salas  were highly motivated to discover the secrets of tango&mdash;but when they talked to  people who had been dancing  for 50 or 60 years,   apparently they didn't  get the right answers.  So they reluctantly decided that these &ldquo;so-called great dancers&rdquo; had &ldquo;personal problems&rdquo;, and they would have to look elsewhere. Salas remembers the  fateful day when their real work began: &ldquo;Gustavo, we are on our own&hellip; it's hard  to talk to these people. We have to start learning from ourselves!&rdquo;</p>
      <p> <img src="6_pics/photos/fabian.jpg" width="220" height="239" class="floatRight" />Salas (right) says their research basically involved finding out what they had to say to each other&mdash;and they worked at it tirelessly<strong>:</strong> &quot;Talking! We spent hours playing billiards and talking. Taking coffees. They would kick us out of one place, and we'd go someplace else.&quot; They were looking for something big.   &ldquo;We have to come up with something that has the significance of a <em>boleo!&quot; </em> Naveira tells Salas. &quot;Imagine the first person that invented the  <em>gancho... </em>how important that is!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>After weeks, or maybe even months, of hanging out and playing pool, their work paid off, because they discovered... the turn! &ldquo;One day we came up with this realization that the fundamental structure in  Argentine Tango was the turn&hellip; but you can't see it until you look for it!&rdquo; Then,  after further research, they found that there are three ways to step<strong>:</strong> &ldquo;Every  leg has three possible movements. You can do an open step, a front step or a  back step. And that's it. You have to be in one of those three positions.&rdquo; This  was quickly followed by the finding that because most humans have two legs, you need to  multiply that number by two&mdash;so there are actually six ways! &ldquo;These realizations  opened all the doors for us at once!&rdquo; says Salas. </p>
      <p>After these early discoveries,  incredible things began to happen. Naveira  remembers<strong>:</strong> &ldquo;One night we discovered  that there were 98 possible <em>ganchos</em> in the turn!&rdquo; (Unfortunately, the interviewer neglected to ask whether you can do them all in the <em>same</em> turn.) They also discovered the <em>ocho  cortado</em><strong>:</strong> &quot;One night Gustavo came up with this idea of  the <em>ocho cortado... </em>he invented it, the milongueros are using it, and they don't even know  where it came from.&quot; Sadly, he says,  Susana Miller eventually stole it from them, and they no longer have it. And  as we have  seen above, they also discovered kicking.</p>
      <p> At one point, the fawning interviewer asks  Salas: &ldquo;Where did the Cross System come from? Is that your work?&rdquo; and Salas  responds, &ldquo;The cross-foot system? Yeah. We named things that most of the people  don't know&hellip; we came up with the idea of showing the cross foot and calling it  that.&rdquo; (Alej was a little surprised at this, because she remembers that when her father was a young man, he was known for dancing <em>vals cruzado</em>. But whatever.)</p>
      <p>As they labored on, they began to realize that tango really  isn&rsquo;t about culture or tradition at all, because it hasn&rsquo;t been around long  enough. &ldquo;Tango is only 50 years old,&rdquo; states Naveira. &ldquo;But what we are doing is  very important&hellip; it could last 3,000 years!&rdquo;</p>
      <p>The interviews wander, but they  generally return to the same theme<strong>:</strong>  That  it was they who are responsible for    all of the  important things that exist in tango today. It's quite an achievement, and  both Salas and Naveira justifiably bristle at calling their work <em>Tango Nuevo, </em> because it's so much more. At first, they called it  <em>CosmoTango</em>&mdash;to denote a sort of all encompassing, &quot;everything&quot; kind of tango that reaches across the universe.  Today, however, both have come to believe that the correct name for what they have achieved is simply <em>Argentine Tango. </em></p>
      <p>The message of the interviews is inescapable<strong>:</strong> Naveira and Salas are the true discoverers of tango! And  like cockroaches and duct tape, their tango  is destined to  live on through global warming, economic collapse,   and nuclear winter. A tango for the cosmos. A tango for 3,000 years! </p>
