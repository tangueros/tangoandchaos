    <p>Of all the things we do for fun, tango may be the most similar to our regular daily routine&mdash;and that creates a problem. No matter where we live or what we do, most of us spend the day walking around and pausing&mdash;so who wants to have a hobby that essentially involves... walking and pausing? This, I think, is the source of the almost irresistible urge many people  have to mess with tango. Whether it&rsquo;s out of ignorance, or arrogance, or simply for profit, there is a large and  prominent group of people who want to re-invent tango by hanging ornaments on it. </p>
    <p>But like it or not, tango is what it is... and the real  tango isn't for everybody. It takes a lot of time, work, and patience to  understand it. Those who put in the time and effort, will eventually discover that the walking and pausing of real tango is far from simple&mdash;it's as different from everyday walking and pausing as swimming is from tennis. And a lucky few, with  enough patience and passion (and a little help), may even find the tango that  Troilo spoke of  when he said, &quot;<em>El tango te espera</em>.&quot; </p>
    <p>So let's get to work. Good tango is in the details&mdash;so let's spend some more time working on a simple part of tango that most instructors rarely even discuss. We're going to talk about the heart of tango technique<strong>:</strong>  how the foot strikes the floor, and stepping in the <em>comp&aacute;s</em>.  </p>

    <p>You may have noticed that the walking and pausing exercise on the last page wasn&rsquo;t that easy. In fact, doing the basic walk <em>without</em> pausing isn't easy either. If you really understand it, and begin to look around the milongas, you&rsquo;ll look a long time before you find someone who does it well. One trouble spot is the place  where the foot contacts the floor. Remember, the goal is to express the <em>comp&aacute;s</em> as perfectly as possible with our bodies, which in this case  means marking the strong beat of the <em>comp&aacute;s</em> with the foot. This is much more difficult than it seems at first... and  like much of the other  material in this chapter,  I don't think it's ever been discussed before. </p>
    <p>Our first job is to make the foot strike the floor  crisply, and cleanly&mdash;but also smoothly. Just like an athlete kicking a soccer ball, to have a chance at success,  we need to set up correctly. So make sure you have all of the basics we have discussed up to this point. (It's best to  review them and practice them a lot, because these aren't things you can learn in a few weeks&mdash;or even a few months.) </p>
    <p>Think about kicking a ball. The way to strike a soccer ball  with power is to relax the foot and ankle, and then quickly  straighten the leg, so that the foot snaps forward.  Let's practice it. Get tall, and balanced  on one Front Balance point, raise the other knee a little, relax your foot and ankle, and then pop  your foot out there. Don't hurt yourself&mdash;do it gently, but do it quickly and sharply, and make sure your knee extends all the way. It should look like you're kicking a nuevo-stage dancer out of a milonga<strong>: </strong></p>

    <p>Take some time to get used to this motion. Try to do it sharply, without  letting any movement transfer to rest of your body. For now, let's just call it a leg-snap. Our objective will be to use it for something quite difficult.  We want to make three things happen simultaneously. The  first two are<strong>:</strong>  To snap our leg straight at exactly the same time that the tipping forward of our  body brings our foot  into contact with the floor.   Or more specifically, when the Front Balance point of our foot contacts the floor. Like a pilot looking for a perfect landing, we are looking for the perfect foot strike. We want  to snap our leg straight, and have our foot strike the floor at the same time. </p>
    <p>But not only must we  make the leg snap, and straighten, just as our foot strikes the floor&mdash;we must also do it  exactly  on the strong beat of the<em> comp&aacute;s</em>. Leg-snap, floor contact, <em>and</em> the strong beat of the music must all coincide. A lot of things can go wrong,  so before we do it right, let's look at a couple of common mistakes <strong>:</strong></p>

    <p>In the video above, the foot has come in a little high, floated above the floor, and then dropped down to make contact. Another way to look at it is that the leg-snap was too early. This can cause the toes to contact the floor first, ahead of the Front Balance point. Now, let's bring in the <em>comp&aacute;s</em><strong>:</strong> </p>

        Are we marking it with the leg-snap, or when the toes contact the floor, or when <br /> 
        the Front Balance point touches&mdash;or does it  fall somewhere in between?</span> <br />

    <p>This kind of stepping is common in the milongas, especially when men take the first step  to walk along the left or right of the woman. If you don't tip forward enough to lead with the chest, the upper body  gets held back just a little. This causes your foot to hang out there above the floor for a split second. It gives your tango a timid look&mdash;like    testing the water temperature with your toes before diving in. </p>
    <p>Now let's look at the opposite situation. This time, the leg-snap comes too late... or maybe the floor arrives too early,  depending on how you look at it<strong>:</strong></p>

    <p>In the video above, we came in a little low, and drove our foot into the floor before finishing the  leg-snap. This can cause  the foot to  slide, or  &quot;skate&quot; a little if the floor is slick, or it may  jerk to a quick stop if it stabs into a sticky surface. This kind of foot strike is associated with another bad habit, because if your foot hits too early, that means your knee is still slightly bent at floor contact. In the milongas they call this &quot;dancing on your knees&quot;. There are some well-known stage dancers who are  notorious for doing it.  </p>
    <p>Dancing this way puts a bit of jerking or bouncing in your step that your partner will feel. But the real problem it creates is with the <em>comp&aacute;s</em>. What  kind of signal are you sending your partner? Exactly when are you marking the <em>comp&aacute;s</em>? Is it when  leg snaps above the floor, or as the foot drops? Is it when the toes hit  the floor, or  when the Front Balance point hits? In the  case above, are we marking the beat  when the foot first dives in and starts sliding&mdash;or when it stops?   </p>
    <p>Finally, let's look at the walking demo from  page 12 again, to see if we can get a confluence of leg-snap, foot strike, and <em>comp&aacute;s</em><strong>:</strong><a name="slide" id="slide"></a></p>

    <p>    Adding the little <em>tick</em> sound&nbsp;files to  this video  drove me crazy. I was trying to match them to the wave graph on the sound track by listening to  the music,  but after about  half an hour I gave up. There was no way I could get them just right. Then, I came at it from the other direction. I ignored the wave graph and the music, and just looked for  the frame in the video where I could clearly see  my foot strike the floor. Then I attached the<em> tick </em>sound to that frame. There are 30 frames per second, and I  picked those where the leg-snap and the floor contact came together. Afterwards, I counted the frames between each foot strike, and found there were the same number between each one&mdash;so  the leg-snap, the floor strike, and the strong beat in this video are  all within 1/30th of a second of each other. I'm pretty picky, but all in all, that's about as close as you need to get. </p>

       On page 14 in chapter six, you perform nice stepping. After your feet contact the ground exactly with the <em>comp&aacute;s</em> there is this sliding effect. Is your partner supposed to do the same effect when you dance together?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;-)

     <div class="answerBox"> 
    <p>I see by the smile that it&rsquo;s probably not a  serious question, but I&rsquo;d like to answer it anyway. The reason I&rsquo;m sliding  is that I used too much<em> Blem</em>.&nbsp; <em>Blem</em> is a furniture polish they sell  in Argentina, and if you spray too much on the floor (which I did), you'll slide at the finish of the step.  </p>
    <p>To answer your question, both the man&rsquo;s and the woman&rsquo;s foot hit at the same time. The man lands more or less on a flat foot, but the woman contacts the floor with the front of her foot, and then rolls backwards down onto her heel&mdash;so if the man&rsquo;s foot slides a bit, the woman probably wouldn&rsquo;t even know it. It happens as she&rsquo;s rolling down onto her heel, and all she should feel is  the man&rsquo;s chest continuing forward.</p>
    <p> Slippery floors can be   a little spooky for women in high heels, but I like them because  it&rsquo;s easier to  walk and pivot. I hate the feeling of having my foot come to a jolting stop on a sticky floor. It&rsquo;s like putting a small brake on the forward momentum of each step, and pivoting can be almost painful, because the foot wants to stay planted, and the twisting force moves up into the ankles and knees.&nbsp; [<a href="../comments_updates_new.htm#floors">Here's a discussion about some of the dance floors in BsAs.</a>] </p>
    <p>A slippery floor will often reveal flaws in step  technique. One problem is bending the leg and pushing off hard into the step. If you do it on a slippery floor, your foot will want to slide back out from under you as you push, and this can be dangerous. The way to avoid it is to initiate each step by  tipping in the  direction you want to go, and let the weight of your upper body carry your  partner along. If it  feels like your supporting foot wants to slip out from under you  as you begin  a step on a slippery dance floor, it's a good indication that you're not efficiently using the weight of the upper body to  begin the step.</p>
    <p>Another problem that can show up on slippery floors is not staying centered laterally&mdash;that is, not placing one foot directly in front of (or behind) the other. If you don't walk with one foot directly in front of the other, you'll get a slight rocking from side to side. On a slippery floor, it can feel  unstable, as if your foot wants to slide out to the side. </p>
    <p>A  man may be able to compensate for the instability he causes,  but it's much worse for the woman who has to  dance with him. She probably won't  notice  if the man's foot slides a little in the direction of travel as he finishes his step, but she will notice  slipping and lurching at the beginning of the step. And any rocking from side to side will make her feel very uncomfortable. Wearing high heels on a slippery floor, and trying to follow a man who's unsteady on his feet is not a good place to be. </p>
