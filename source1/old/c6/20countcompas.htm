    <p class="paragraphHeader">Dreams and Reality </p>
    <p>Once we've begun to figure out how to stand and step, the next stage  is to  &quot;dance&quot;. Most of us start down the tango road with some sort of  vision. It could be anything from  dreams of glory picked up from   watching tango in movies and stage shows,  to simply wanting to keep from embarrassing ourselves in  a milonga. Surprisingly, dreams of the first kind are much easier to follow. Only a small  handful of people actually  make a living     by performing,    but their shows have spawned  a  worldwide system of classes and workshops for learning stage tango. </p>
    <p>Ironically, however, the techniques needed to  become a competent social dancer are more difficult to  acquire. The problem is that  the tango of the milongas isn't made up of figures and embellishments.  Social tango  involves    moving  around the floor  and using the  music&mdash;and that has very little to do with the patterns  that fit so well into the &quot;demonstrate, copy, and memorize&quot; approach of the classroom. The closer you look at the infinite varieties of good social dancing,  the more difficult the task  seems. It's hard to even know where to begin&mdash;but let's see if we can find a place.  </p>
    <p class="paragraphHeader style1"> Counting the <em>Comp&aacute;s</em> </p>
    <p>The goal of  social tango is to express the music with the movements of the upper bodies of the partners. Good social dancers keep their  upper bodies  still and connected, while navigating around the floor to the cadence and melody of the music. When it's done well, it's similar to the  apparently effortless movements of  an orchestra  conductor's baton. Words, notes, and rhythms are distilled down to the movement of the dancers torsos traveling through  three-dimensional space. How is it done? If you examine the best dancers, you'll find that   one of the basic  building blocks  of this movement is a series of quick steps  that hit  the consecutive beats of the music. Most  changes in speed, direction, and rotation  are initiated by these runs of quick steps, so you need to understand them if  you want to learn how to move well in a milonga. </p>
    <p>Normally when we talk about the <em>comp&aacute;s</em>, we prefer using the terms  &quot;strong beat&quot; and  &quot;weak beat&quot;. So we  describe    the <em>dos por cuatro</em> cadence of tango  as     a strong beat, with a weak beat in between. In simple  walking, we just step on the strong beats. But if we  want to    also step on the weak beats in between,   the best way to understand what's happening is to  count each step  numerically. So as  soon as we begin to step on consecutive beats, we'll count  the first strong step as &quot;1&quot;, and then we'll count every consecutive beat thereafter&mdash;until we return to only stepping on  the strong beats. So in the video below,   instead of counting the quick steps with   the &quot;<em>tick - tock - tick</em>&quot;  on the soundtrack, we'll count them as &quot;<em>1-2-3</em>&quot;<strong>:</strong> </p>

    </div>
    <p><br />
    In the video above, let's count our steps on the consecutive &quot;<em>STRONG - weak - STRONG</em>&quot; beats  as  &quot;<em>1-2-3</em>&quot;. Most tango dancing is based on these short  3-run segments that  hit one weak beat. They're used for changes of direction and rotational  movements, and women do them all the time when they cross, or follow a <em>giro</em>. But there's no reason to restrict ourselves to only three quick steps. We can do as many as we want&mdash;as long as we end up back on the <em>STRONG</em> beat. That mean's, our runs of quick steps must always end on an odd number<strong>:</strong> 3, 5, 7, 9, 11... and on up. You can go as high as you want. Let's look at some milongueros, and see how this fit's into dancing<strong>:</strong> </p>

      <span class="pictureCaption">Roberto Noli, Blas, and Ricardo stepping on consecutive beats. If you count the &quot;<em>tick-tocks</em>&quot; you'll find<br />
    runs of 3,5,7,9,11... and 17! &nbsp;(In tango, runs of consecutive steps must always  consist of an odd number.)</span></div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If you count the runs in the video, you'll see that Roberto &quot;<em>El Rey del Comp&aacute;s</em>&quot; Noli uses some 3's, mixed in with runs of 9, 7, and 11 (dancing with Adriana). Blas uses 5's and 3's (with Graciela), and in the last part of the video, Ricardo uses a 7-run for his first <em>corrida</em>, and then finishes with a long 17-step run, that curves through a <em>giro</em> (with Alej). Long runs of consecutive steps weren't unusual  for Ricardo when he danced to <em>tango picado. </em>Like Roberto, he used 7's and 11's all time, and I even have  video of him  hitting 19 consecutive beats in a row.</p>
    <p> For practice, you can go back two pages  and  count the  consecutive step runs   Alejandra and Ricardo  use in the <em>Adios Arrabal</em> video. Then, put on some music and go after it. Don't worry about technique at first, or doing it with a  partner. Just  practice  doing  5's, 7's,  9's, and 11's in a straight line. See how high you can go, and  get used to what it feels like with different kinds of music.  Then, begin concentrating on  good  posture and stepping sharply onto a straight leg. Finally, try some  short runs with a partner.  </p>
    <p class="paragraphHeader">Slowing Down </p>
    <p>The tango in the  video  above is a sample of good social  tango&mdash;but it&rsquo;s only a small sample&mdash;and it's weighted toward  <em>tango picado</em>. That is, it represents a way of dancing to the more  rhythmic tangos of the D'Arienzo tradition. But tango can be  danced in many different ways, and music that doesn&rsquo;t have such a pronounced  beat may call for a different way of dancing. Let's look at an  example of excellent tango that isn&rsquo;t built around such obvious runs of consecutive quick steps<strong>:</strong><a name="x" id="x"></a></p>

      <span class="pictureCaption">Here is a very relaxed and sophisticated way of dancing tango that uses 3 and 5 runs in the form of  pivots<br /> 
      and weight
      changes to dance in  restricted space. The best milongueras love  this  kind of dancing. </span></div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This is<em> very</em> good dancing by Milonguero X. Tango for adults. It's so relaxed and natural that it seems almost casual, but it's actually very  sophisticated. The reason it appears unhurried  is because X is prepared, and on top of the music. Notice how his feet, and also his partner's feet, float and pivot with   the cadence and the melody. Our natural tendency is  to look first and listen second&mdash;but the key to understanding the great milongueros is to  listen carefully first, and <em>then</em> look.  Watch the video, but try to let your visual input take a back seat. To   help focus more on the music, you  might try seeing them the way I do when I dance next to them. Try  focusing your eyes a few inches to the side, and watch them with your peripheral vision. Your goal is to  absorb everything in the music, and  separate the parts, so that you can begin to  hear what X is hearing.   Then, let their movement sneak back in. </p>
    <p>At the beginning, he  takes more aggressive steps to express the melody of the full orchestra. Then toward the middle, if you watch his right elbow, you can see him begin to pick up the softer  melodies. First he follows the  violin with his upper body, and then the bandoneon.   (<em>My</em> <em>God! </em>Listen to that bandoneon! Who's playing  that thing?) Each time he reaches back with his right foot, he varies the length and the timing of his step  in order to bring his partner around and follow  the  orchestra as they draw out the notes. Then, when the sharper cadences of the bandoneon and piano come in,   he marks it on the floor  with   small pivots and weight changes. All of this is done in very limited space. He and the people around him come extremely close to each other, but they don't even seem to be  aware of it. They all know exactly what's going around them. </p>
    <p>Now, look at his partner. Imagine you have some sort of advanced computer program that erases every other dancer in the video except her&mdash;a program that leaves her dancing  alone  on an empty floor. Then, run the program,  and  watch her feet. You'll see that she's not  trying to impress anyone by adding decorations. She's dancing only for herself. But if you look closely, you can see that she's  completely involved in  the music. This is a great example of the subtle things we talked about in the section on women's dancing back in Chapter 3. She senses every move her partner will make, and then plays  along with him. For me, if  I'm able to really isolate her dancing, with her feet gliding intricately just  inches from the floor, it almost looks like  the bow of a violin playing along with the music.  </p>
    <p>Milonguero X prefers to remain anonymous. He  doesn't dance with a lot of women, but the best milongueras love to dance with  him, because he hears all the things in the music that they  hear. In this video, he  does runs of 3,  5, and 7, (and maybe 9) consecutive beats... but they're very difficult to see, because they're hidden among the  pivots and  weight changes.  (I was going to put<em> tick-tocks</em> on the sound track to identify them, but it's a lot of work&mdash;and with a little practice, you should be able to find them on your own.) &nbsp;X doesn't use them as much for moving forward, as for rotating, and moving around in place. Part of this is style, part is his response to this kind of music, and part is simply because the available space in the <em>ronda</em> is  so limited. </p>
    <p>X has been dancing  tango all his life, but this is the only time he's ever been filmed. No one will ever know who he is, or anything about him&mdash;but at least what he does has been saved. We've filmed a hundred milongueros and a thousand plus tangos, but these are the moments I wait  for. They  make it all worth it. As far as I'm concerned, you can take all the stage shows and all the <em>Campeonatos del Mundo</em> the city wants to sponsor and throw them in the <em>Riachuelo</em>. One tango like this is worth more than all of them. </p>
