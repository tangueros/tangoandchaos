      <p class="paragraphHeader">The Point is the Point </p>
      <p>The key to dancing well in a crowded milonga is to adjust the way you think. If you try to dance tango by doing steps and following a pattern on the floor, or if you approach tango as a series of moves that require pausing to   do figures, you'll be constantly frustrated. Rather than thinking about tango in terms of moves and patterns, I think it's  better to try focusing on a single point in the middle of the chest. This is  the spot where the man sends information to his partner&mdash;and also the spot where she receives it. Good milongueros and milongueras keep their arms and torsos still, and focus everything on this single point at the center of the embrace. But what, exactly, do they do with it? </p>
      <p> The goal is to make this small point follow the music smoothly through time and space. The head, shoulders, arms, and torso  remain still; and in a sense,  the arms, and even the legs, nerves,  muscles, and the $200 shoes, become nothing more than a support system. When it's done well,  the result is a smooth, natural, three-dimensional expression of the music. Like an orchestra conductor's baton moving through space, the goal is to create a physical expression of sound and cadence. </p>
      <p>When you begin a tango on a very crowded floor,  you might start with  very little. Stretch up to find your   posture and  balance, tip forward slightly into the embrace, and then  relax for a second. Let the music flow by you, think about  the center of your  chest,    and  then begin to pick up some of the cadence or melody.  If you can't take big steps,  just let your imaginary conductor's baton follow the music in  small ways, and let your  partner feel it. If you know the music, you can do surprisingly expressive things with a little pivoting, rocking, and  weight shifting. (We've already looked at an exercise  <a href="9twist.htm" target="_top">on page 9</a> that involves moving the chest while balancing in one spot. You can even go back and use it to practice ultra-small-space dancing. Put on some of your favorite music, and see how creatively you can follow the music with only weight shifts and some twisting of the torso.) </p>

      <p>Earlier in the chapter we demonstrated how walking can result in a simple, harmonic expression of the <em>strong-weak</em> of the <em>dos por cuatro</em>. The chest and upper body accelerate  down  through the strong beat,  and then rises and slows through the weak one, like a roller coaster going over rises and dips: </p>

      <p>The idea is to   get used to feeling tango through the movement of the chest&mdash;but let's look at it using hand movement. I'll never get a job conducting and orchestra, but maybe this will help to demonstrate the idea. Here's how the imaginary point at the connection of  the man and the woman's chests  might move through space during normal tango walking<strong>:</strong></p>

        <span class="pictureCaption">With good walking technique, the upper bodies of the partners  rise and fall along with<br /> 
        the 
        weak and strong beats 
        of the <em>comp&aacute;s</em>. This is  the core of musical expression in tango. </span></div>
      <p><br />
        The up and down movement is exaggerated, but I hope it helps get the idea across.
      The hand  accelerates down through the valleys of the strong beat, and then slows and  rises through the weak ones, as it follows the strong and weak  beats of the <em>comp&aacute;s</em>. This is a  representation of the way the chest and upper bodies move to the music in normal walking, when the  weight bearing leg remains   straight throughout the step. It looks something like a roller coaster ride. </p>
      <p>But riding over the same sized hills and dips all the time can get boring&mdash;so let's look at some ways to change the path of the roller coaster. One way  is to take a longer step. Since a long step must cover more ground in  exactly the same time period as a short step (one beat),  a tango couple has to   move faster as they sink through the strong beat. Also,   because they stride out farther, they sink lower. As a result, they  accelerate through a deeper valley&mdash;with more  speed, and also more rise and fall. (This probably doesn't need to be repeated,  but... <em>never</em> do this randomly. Only use it to emphasize something in the music.) I'll try to show it by hand<strong>: </strong><a name="muneca" id="muneca"></a></p>

        <span class="pictureCaption">One of the  most powerful and beautiful tools in tango:  &nbsp;A large step taken at the right time. </span></div>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>It's a little rough, but it should give some idea. There's a world of the possibilities in the most basic of tango movements. Putting one or two larger steps into a run of normal length steps, or using one after a pause, is a powerful way to emphasize something in the music. (If you want to  go back and see how this works in the real world,  <a href="../chapt_5video/27pocho.htm" target="_top">Pocho and Alej do it beautifully  in the video on page 12,  Chapter 5</a>.) </p>
      <p>Another way to change the path of the roller coaster is to step on some of the weak beats. Let's try to trace what happens when we hit just one weak beat<strong>:</strong> </p>

        <span class="pictureCaption">The path of a quick step. </span></div>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The clip above shows the path the upper bodies might follow when we add  a  weak beat during a walk.  The quick step taken on the weak beat inserts a small dip between the deeper valleys of the steps taken on the strong beats. It feels sort of like a musical speed bump in the road. </p>
      <div align="center" class="paragraphHeader style4"> <strong>****</strong></div>
      <p>So far in this chapter, we&rsquo;ve been looking at ways to dance tango with some very simple tools. About all we&rsquo;ve been doing is walking to different combinations of the beats, and varying the length of the steps a little. Most of the academic world of tango quickly moves past this, and devotes a lot of  class time to   figures that include the   arms, legs, torso, and the entire body. Which raises a question: Why would anyone want to  focus all of their musical expression on  one point, when so many other parts of the body are available? Doesn't learning a greater variety of movements  create a better opportunity for expressing the music?</p>
      <p> Obviously, I don&rsquo;t think so. To say that the figures and moves taught in many workshops are  more expressive than the tango of the milongas is like saying an organ is more expressive than a violin. An organ may have a  hundred keys and knobs&mdash;but a good musician can do just as much with the four strings of a violin.  In a few pages we&rsquo;ll add a couple of new things to our basic tango tools, but first, we&rsquo;ll examine how simply curving our harmonic walk  in the restricted space of a milonga can be used to express tango <em>vals</em> in full, three-dimensional Technicolor<strong>:</strong> </p>

            <p>The walking demos in chapter 6 are indeed illuminating. I had some teachers (In Israel) who taught the basics of walking along similar lines, but your visualization completely clarifies it.</p>
            <p> An association that occurred to me reading your description of the biomechanical efficiency aspect of the tango walking relates to playing music<strong>:</strong> the majority of the maestros do not express emotion in their faces or body gestures, as no emotional energy is wasted before going directly to the instrument. Watching Troilo playing is a great example. The playing technique, exactly as the correct walking technique, is just the carrier frequency of the emotional information. </p>

    <p><strong>Answer</strong>:<br /> 
      Thanks for the great comment. Sometimes when you present something it&rsquo;s hard to know whether it&rsquo;s clear or not, so it&rsquo;s nice to hear that the walking demos are helpful.</p>
    <p> I use lots of sports comparisons (probably too many), but your music analogy is better. As you said, it&rsquo;s like we only have so much emotional energy, so focusing it all into the musical instrument, or into the place at the center of the embrace where a dancer communicates with his or her partner, can be more powerful than bringing in a lot of  other  gestures. (I think I just restated what you wrote&hellip; only not as well. I should have just said, &ldquo;Yep&rdquo;.) </p>
