    <p>The more I dance and learn, the closer I move toward one very simple idea<strong>:</strong> In the end, tango is nothing more than friends gathering together  to share the music. It all begins, and ends with that. Tango is loving the music, and caring about each other. That may sound a little &ldquo;new age&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s true. Another way to put it is that the continued existence of tango requires a respect for the music, and a respect for each other. If you have an environment where those two things exist, then you can celebrate tango. If you don&rsquo;t, then you can&rsquo;t. If you  have instructors who, both by example and word, are committed to teaching students how to navigate and dance in a way that doesn&rsquo;t bother other dancers, then you can have milongas. If you don't, you can still have classes and <em>practicas </em>where people work on steps and figures&mdash;but that's all you'll have. </p>
    <p> Let&rsquo;s continue with our discussion of navigation. We'll look at some things   we see people  doing all the time that don't work in  crowded conditions. I think most of these dancers are trying hard to fit in&mdash;but even when they're not bothering anyone else, they often look frustrated. They look like they're not really having much fun.  The first kind of tango that doesn't work well in a crowded milonga is... </p>
    <p class="paragraphHeader">Square Corners </p>
    <p>This kind of dancing is built around the &quot;8-count basic&quot; step pattern. We sometimes see it today  in older couples. They're often  very polite on the floor, but their dancing has too many sharp edges. I say older couples, because this is probably the first type of tango taught in classes, and because many young people prefer a newer version of figure based tango. This tango is from the 1990s. It think the  Dinzels popularized it, and it's surprising how many big names in tango today began  with them.   The Dinzels came to tango from Argentine <em>folklore</em>, and their approach was to identify as many elements as they could, give them names, and then link them together with rectangular step patterns. This kind of early academic tango looks somewhat out of date today, but there are still lots of instructors teaching it. I'm familiar with it, because it's the way I began learning tango<strong>: </strong></p>

    <p>This step-pattern  tango provides a kind of order and security that's perfect for  classes. There are routes to follow,  and small figures with different names&mdash;and  places to pause and  perform them.   The patterns look almost like circuit diagrams. This is what they might  look like on a crowded floor<strong>:</strong> </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Obviously  this kind of dancing is  a disaster in a milonga. You sometimes  see couples that have learned this tango standing in one spot,  waiting for enough space to  complete their pattern. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="paragraphHeader">Separate Barrios </p>
    <p>This is the classic tango of performers. I've used the words  &quot;park and perform&quot; or &quot;pause and pose tango&quot; to describe it. I also  like the term &quot;everybody's a star&quot; tango&mdash;but then, I'm  a smart-ass.    It's tango that focuses  on  elaborate, stationary choreography<strong>:</strong> </p>

    <p>This tango  not only requires rehearsal by  both partners, but it also uses  large amounts of  space for extended periods of time.  The problem is that if everyone begins to use  more than  their normal share of personal space (see <a href="34basicnav.htm#myspace">page 36</a>) for more than a few beats of the <em>comp&aacute;s</em>, everything will grind to a stop and the floor will  begin to look like it's been divided up into a map of the BsAs barrios<strong>:</strong> </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><br />
    </p>
    <div align="center"><img src="6_pics/Barrios5.jpg" width="438" height="250" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The pattern on this map  is fine  for<em> practicas</em>, where people are expected to  stake out their own areas to work on things. For  a while in the U.S.,  there seemed to be the belief  that it was okay to take space in the middle of a milonga to do stationary figures.  But we're talking about crowded milongas, and in a crowded milonga, the center of the floor needs to circulate just like the <em>rondas</em> that surround it. (I remember walking into a large milonga in the U.S. once where people were  circulating more of less normally&mdash;but   a well-known  ballroom couple was doing exaggerated poses in the middle of the floor. The woman would raise her leg way up high and hold it. Or they would embrace, sink down to the floor together, and then slowly come back up. The effect was creepy.  It looked like a queen bee surrounded by drones, slowly circling her as she  postured and performed. Or   like some   ancient Aztec ritual.)</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="paragraphHeader">Steppin' Large </p>
    <p>There's a young guy who has been showing up at one of the  milongas we go to. He's a good dancer, and he's respectful of everyone. But he has the academic dancer's habit of taking the same big,  dramatic step all the time, and it causes  lots of problems for him. He's like a guy who spent a lot of money on a big, fast car with high gears, but has to spend most of his time on winding roads. Or stuck in traffic. Small taxis and motorbikes whiz by, and he can barely get out of first gear between the traffic lights. </p>
    <p>The solution for him would be to realize that big steps are very nice&mdash;but  so are little tiny steps. In fact without little steps, big steps don't mean much. Even    changes of weight from one foot to the other that don't go anywhere  can be very expressive. The art is in varying the mix. And the highest art is to use these variations to creatively express the music, and skillfully navigate the floor  at the same time. The challenge  of sharing tango close to other couples that understand this is one of the great pleasures of tango. It's the opposite of bothering other dancers, because it actually  adds  to everyone's enjoyment. I won't include a video example of large-step tango, because it's  fairly self-explanatory. But I do have a vision in my mind of what tango should look like. We'll stick with our BsAs theme, and represent it this way. This my mental picture of the kind of movement  Alej and I  create when we dance&mdash;of the path we might follow<strong>: </strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <div align="center">
      <p class="pictureCaption">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="6_pics/stick_man/nav30.jpg" width="382" height="217" vspace="4" /><br />
        I think of the path we follow on the floor of a milonga<br />
        as looking something like these traditional BsAs <em>firuletes</em>. <br />
            <br />
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <p class="paragraphHeader"><em>Firuletes</em></p>
    <p>Finally, here's how our milonga might look when  people  use the <em>comp&aacute;s</em> to curve the paths of their dancing. It's a mix of different step sizes, occasional pauses, and curving runs that fuse into <em>giros</em>. For me it's the perfect way to express the hard-soft of tango. I think if you look at the video of  most of the great dancers we've put on the site, you'll see floor movement that looks something like the blue lines here&mdash;something like the traditional <em>firulete</em> art  that decorated <em>Manoblanca's</em> cart<strong>:</strong> </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <div align="center">
      <p class="pictureCaption">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="6_pics/stick_man/nav19.jpg" width="700" height="400" vspace="7" /><br />
        The yellow couple is  stopping to perform figures, 
          and taking big steps. The blue lines <br />
          represent the paths of  couples that are dancing curved <em>corriditas</em>, or &quot;curved-runs&quot;.
      <br />
          <br />
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Obviously the yellow couple is having a tough time. They represent the young guy who tries to dance by  stopping to perform figures, and then using  large steps to move to a new place on the floor. You might look at this pattern for a minute, and think about which paths   come closest to representing a  physical expression of the music. </p>
