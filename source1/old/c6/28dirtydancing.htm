    <p class="paragraphHeader">Dirty Dancing </p>
    <p>Sloppy  tango technique comes in two basic varieties<strong>:</strong> Full time, and part time. Full time is ingrained. It means habitually dancing  in ways  that inhibit your ability to move, lead, and express the music. Part time  dirty dancing, on the other hand, happens when good habits  temporarily break down. This is usually  caused by trying to dance too fast,  over-reaching for  unnatural moves, or  by being uncomfortable in crowded conditions. </p>
    <p>We've already discussed problems with the arms and  upper body in the first part of the chapter, so  we'll limit  our discussion here to  dirty things that happen below the waist.  Here's a list of a dirty half dozen<strong>:</strong> </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>1.	Creeping &mdash; stepping onto a bent leg <br />
        2.	Shuffling &mdash; not picking up the foot and stepping sharply into the floor <br />
        3.	Duck walking &mdash; not bringing the feet together <br />
        4. Bouncing &mdash; bending and straightening the legs at the wrong time<br />
        5.	Reaching &mdash; stepping  without having the body's weight  over the leg <br />
      6. Asymmetry &mdash; stepping differently with one leg than the other&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Developing clean, relaxed tango technique is  hard&mdash;and losing bad habits is even harder. I know, because in the beginning I picked up lots of bad habits by taking too many classes and memorizing too many  steps. Eventually, though, I threw  everything  out, and fell back on  something that had always worked for me in the past. The solution turned out to be... drills. </p>
    <p class="paragraphHeader">The Case for  Drills  </p>
    <p>I know... drills don't sound like  much fun. &quot;Drill&quot; is  a word we usually associate with    going to the dentist or marching around with a rifle. But  if you're serious about getting better,  the right tango drills  can really help. And the best  thing is that it gives me another  chance  to talk about sports. So here comes a ski story: </p>
    <p>In the Western U.S. there are mountains where snow stays on the ski slopes all year,  and many racers go there in the summer  to work on technique. There are lots of  different training camps, and many of them  are similar to the tango  workshops that  attract students by bringing in  known performers and   teaching dramatic steps. These camps  set up a  course, bring in a well-known ski racer, and demonstrate the latest tips for cutting through the gates. The kids love it, because they get a chance to  copy their hero, and pick up some of the latest tricks they've seen on the World Cup. Many of them  end up skiing faster at the end of the camp&mdash;but the problem is that these camps don't really identify and correct the small technical flaws that limit every racer. And many of the students leave   with bad habits   even more deeply ingrained. </p>
    <p>My friend Olle   also runs  summer ski camps, but he has a different approach. His athletes  rarely run the racecourses, and they don't practice knocking down gates. Instead, they spend their time doing drills. Olle studies video of the world's fastest skiers,  breaks their skiing down into discrete movements, and then  he develops drills to practice each movement. The idea is to pick one or two basic elements,  and practice them over and over in an exaggerated way. When they become easy, then you work on something else. Slowly, you begin to combine the elements, and you become accustomed to moving in the right way. </p>
    <p>Some of the drills look  silly, because they greatly exaggerate body positions and ways of moving, and at first people ridiculed them. But over time,  they turned out to be so effective that they're now used regularly at all levels of skiing. Young athletes use them to learn,  and the best World Cup racers use them to return to good form when bad habits begin to creep in during  a season of racing.   </p>
    <p>Obviously skiing and tango are  different, and motivated semi-professional athletes are very different than social tango dancers. I'm not sure if drills will work for social tango dancers, but let's try one anyway.</p>
    <p>There are several keys to making a drill work. First you need to identify bad biomechanical movements  (like the 6 we listed above). Then, you need to identify one or two  good elements, and do them  in a very exaggerated way to replace  the bad habits. They should be so exaggerated in the drill that doing them normally under stress  on a racecourse (or in a milonga), becomes easy. Here's an example of a side step drill.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>First, we'll identify some bad habits. Here are a couple   from the last page<strong>:</strong></p>

    <p>The above video  includes improper leg bending and straightening (problem #4 from our list), and reaching without having weight over the leg (problem #5).</p>

    <p>Now let's add  some more<strong>:</strong></p>

      <span class="pictureCaption">Classic dirty dancing. </span></div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You may need to look closely to see the problems in  the video above, because I didn't exaggerate them. First, notice that I'm stepping onto legs that are slightly bent (problem #1). Also, if you look closely at the trailing leg, you'll see that I don't pick it up, and return it cleanly to the floor. It follows the lead leg by sort of dragging along behind (problem #2). Finally, you'll see that by picking up the lead leg, and shuffling with the following one, I'm stepping asymmetrically   (#6 from the list). </p>
    <p>This is a classic example of dirty dancing. Nothing is  grossly apparent, but the result is a sort of weak, non-tango  way of moving. (I could have made it even worse by adding #3 from the list, and not bringing my feet together at the end of the step). These problems can  be caused by  generally sloppy dancing, but they  can also appear temporarily when people are thinking about doing complicated patterns, or trying to step too  quickly. Their technique breaks down, and instead of picking up their feet and stepping sharply onto a straight leg, they shuffle on bent knees.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Now, we'll try  a drill that accentuates keeping the legs straight, tipping into the step with the upper body,   picking up the feet, and landing crisply with the weight over  a straight leg<strong>:</strong></p>

      <span class="pictureCaption">This is only a drill. </span></div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> Concentrate and try to be very precise. Stand perfectly straight and balanced like a tree, and then begin your tip. Do nothing for a moment, and then quickly snap your leg straight. If you get used to the way this feels, it should  help you notice when your technique begins to slip away. As soon as you start to bounce and reach, or shuffle to the side on bent legs, the memory of this drill should cause a small alarm to  go off. </p>
    <p>By the way, this is also a great balance and timing drill. You need to   time it so you land exactly as your leg locks straight, with just enough momentum to carry you back up to the balance point over  the other leg. Then you hesitate for a moment,  and begin to tip back the other way. It's  difficult, and you'll need to experiment a little to get the length of the side step just right so you can rise up high and balanced, and then tip back. (You can make it even more difficult by eventually trying to do it so that you land right on a strong beat of the <em>comp&aacute;s</em>. I was going to try to demo it with music, but...  I've never been able to do it.)</p>
    <p> You don't need to do this drill a lot. In fact, don't do it at all if you don't like it. The key to making drills work is to find and exaggerate different elements of good technique, and really focus and do them right a few times. Then put them away and come back again when you're fresh. </p>
    <p class="paragraphHeader">Quick and Dirty </p>
    <p>Clean technique often breaks down in a side step  in the middle of complicated   figures, but it's even more common for technique to break down because of speed.  In   tango, hitting a weak beat means stepping cleanly more than two times a   second, and a fast <em>vals</em> can require  stepping more than three  times   per second. Here's  what usually happens<strong>:</strong> </p>

      <span class="pictureCaption">In the first walk from  right to left, I take the  quick step  onto a bent knee.<br /> 
    The second walk, from left to right, shows a shuffling quick step. </span></div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We're doing two different walks in the demo above. In the first walk from right to left, the quick step is taken onto a bent knee. Then, in the second walk returning from left to right, we do a quick-step shuffle. </p>
    <p>In the first walk, you can see that my leg isn&rsquo;t quite straight as my foot lands for the quick step, while the second walk from the left to right is a little like the side step shuffle demonstrated above. The trailing leg drags weakly behind the leading leg, and the foot slides in for a soft landing. It has a weak look, almost like a slight limp. The first walk shows creeping, the second shuffling, and both demonstrate problem #6 from the list&mdash;stepping asymmetrically. </p>
    <p>Both problems result from stepping quickly. As our feet move faster, we naturally want  to lower our center balance and keep our feet close to the floor, so we tend to  bend our knees and shuffle. Staying low and keeping the feet close to the floor is actually a very efficient way to move quickly, and it's great technique for many sports.  There are drills in basketball and football where athletes practice it all the time. </p>
    <p>The way to clean up a sloppy quick step is to slow  down, and then exaggerate good technique. In the drill below, we'll try to take a  clean leading step,  with  weight solidly over the leg, and we'll make sure our   knee straightens just as our foot contacts the floor. Then we'll  try to mirror it with our quick step, by picking  up the trailing leg, and  stepping sharply onto a locked knee<strong>:</strong></p>

      <span class="pictureCaption">In this drill, we slow down and  pick up our feet. It's important to  step sharply,<br /> 
    and to lock the   knee when the foot contacts the floor on the quick step.</span></div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The key is to do each step  slowly and precisely with each leg&mdash;and there's a secret. Try thinking of  both knees  locking  exactly when the foot contacts the floor. Instead of counting the quick as &quot;<em>strong...weak...strong</em>&quot; or &quot;<em>one...two...three</em>&quot;, you might try this<strong>:</strong> Start with a good walk, and then say &quot;<em>lock...lock...lock</em>&quot;, so that both knees straighten and lock completely with each step  of the <em>corridita</em>. Do it slowly, and also  think about consciously raising the knee before and after the quick, so that both feet  come down for a clean landing. Then,  gradually increase the speed, until you can do it in  the <em>comp&aacute;s</em>.  It's almost inevitable that your technique will break down a little during quick steps, but the more you practice, the cleaner your dancing will become.<em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></em><br />
