    <p>The problem with learning tango isn't that there aren't enough classes. The problem is that there are too <em>many</em>&mdash;and most of them are bad. A serious student of tango   is forced to  sort through a lot of garbage to find something valuable. In the end,  the real challenge becomes not  so much figuring out what  tango is, but what it isn't. </p>
    <p>When I began, there was  no lack of learning opportunities. Although the Great Tango Boom was in it's early stages, dozens of  workshops and videos were already available.  Argentines  were traveling and performing  in shows, and although most of them were barely competent to dance in a milonga, they were more than willing to give classes. Some  students took a few lessons, caught tango fever, and decided to teach as well. They  simply picked up things  they liked,  put their own spin on them, and began to teach tango. Classes taught by local enthusiasts began to appear everywhere. Many of this first generation of local teachers are still  at it today... and as tango continues to grow,  some of their students pick up a few things, mix in their own ideas, and    start to teach also. It's a  process that has taken on a life of it's own&mdash;a   constant reinvention of tango by people  who don't understand  its  subtleties or its culture. The result is a weird mix that's that's  unlike any tango that ever existed in Buenos Aires .  </p>
    <p>It all began with the poses, pauses,  and <em>ganchos</em> of the earliest stage dancers, moved on through   the spins, <em>sacadas</em>, and kicks  that were marketed as <em>nuevo</em>, and currently seems to be  passing through a phase of <em>volcada</em> mania. None of this ever had anything to do with the milongas, but almost like a payback for the    fire ants and Africanized honeybees that invaded the U.S. from South America,   some tango tourists from the North are  starting to bring it with them when they visit. </p>
    <p>In this section,  we'll go back and look at a couple of the performers who were influential in the early tango for export movement. Before anyone jumps all over me, let me say this: They are all skilled and talented dancers, and they are an inspiration to watch. Like a lot of other  people, I  tried to copy them&mdash;but although what they did was very  good,  a lot of it didn't work well as social tango. We'll try to show both why it's good,  and also why most of it doesn't work in a milonga.  </p>
    <p class="paragraphHeader">The King of the Bent Knee </p>
    <p>After I gave up on classes, I decided to find the very best  tango in the world and try to copy it.  My reasoning was this: There is only one big budget tango movie in existence, so it must have the best dancers&mdash;and they must be dancing the very best tango.  The movie was Carlos Saura's <em>Tango</em>, and the film's high point is Carlos Copes dancing to <em>Recuerdo</em>  in front of a live orchestra. The best dancer, in the best part, of the best  movie. How could I go wrong? Here it is, first without the music<strong>:</strong> </p>

      <span class="pictureCaption">Carlos Copes using a very stylized leg bend.</span></div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Interesting, isn't it?&nbsp; I spent a lot of time practicing it, but today, it seems like tango from another planet. Notice how Copes  and his partner stand tall, and then  slowly bend their knees and  drop  down so they're  almost a full head shorter. Then they rise again, and then sink back, so they can  tiptoe along  down low.  It's a very stylized way of moving with no connection to natural stepping. Their heads look like balloons being carried along by  the wind;  sometimes they descend like they're   being blown under a low bridge, and then they gently rise again with the air currents. And  there's the smoldering stare... where did that come from?&nbsp; It must have started with that notorious old  movie clip  of Rudolph Valentino in a  gaucho outfit, seducing his partner  with  his eyes while dancing &quot;tango&quot;. </p>
    <p>This   is probably the most choreographed three minutes of dancing in the history of tango. I mean that literally. It's the centerpiece of   the only big budget tango movie ever made (Saura is the Spanish director who also did <em>Carmen</em>). Every twitch, move, and facial expression of both partners has certainly been rehearsed and rehearsed, and shot and re-shot.  The scene is supposed to take place in  a milonga, where Copes selects his dance partner at random, but it's obvious from the very beginning that it lacks the most basic elements of social tango.  The  first two steps, where they look at each other, and then extend their legs out to the side at exactly the same time have no more spontaneous leading and following  than a synchronized swimming routine. But for some reason, I kept thinking I could use the video to learn  social dancing. Looking back on it, it's obvious that it was a only a made up scene in a movie. Movies are supposed to be fantasies. Who would be dumb enough to actually   use it as a model for dancing with different partners at a milonga? </p>
    <p>Well, apparently I was. I kept at it for a while, but of course it never worked. So I eventually  began to get tired of it. Then, I actually began to  despise it.   I didn't like it at all for a long time, and yet... there's something about it... </p>
    <p>Here it is with music<strong>:</strong></p>

      <span class="pictureCaption">Copes   follows the orchestra by continually flexing  and  straightening his legs. </span></div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The thing about it is... it's good! It took me a long time to come full circle, but I finally  began to see how well it's done. Try  the &quot;block out the lower body test&quot;. If you hold up your hand, or a piece of paper so that you only see the upper bodies,  I think you'll find that the way Copes and his partner flow with the orchestra is spectacular. It's creative, and  it shows that Copes really loves and understands Pugliese's  great tango. But social tango, it  ain't. </p>
    <p>Imagine trying to dance in a milonga this way. Most of us BsAs tango addicts  go out 3 or 4 times a week. Let's see...  3 milongas a week, about 10 <em>tandas</em> per milonga, that's around 120 tangos a week.  Copes and his partner stand up tall and sink  down about 25 times in this single tango,  so  that's like... 100 knee bends per <em>tanda</em>!  Even assuming couples could somehow figure out how to stand a foot apart  and follow each other up  and down all the time, it would still be 1,000  knee bends every time you go out dancing! Or maybe they're more like half squats&mdash;but either way, walking along for half of every tango in a semi-crouch would be a workout.</p>
    <p> Not to mention the weirdness of staring intently into someone else's face while you dance. Do the arithmetic, and you'll find it would mean 10 minutes of  staring for every  tanda. That's about an hour and half per night, or... six hours every week! Yikes! Six hours a week of putting your face up close to someone else, and staring into their eyes. Imagine, friends, strangers, tourists, ugly women, beautiful women... staring hard into their faces for hours, and trying not to blink. And imagine what it must be like to teach it... having to gaze  into your students eyes all the time. </p>
    <p> But still, Copes and his partner nail it. They move well, and their posture is perfect. Even  the dueling <em>ganchos</em> at the end aren't bad&mdash;although I suspect it may have been the inspiration for an instructor I knew who eventually turned into a <em>gancho</em> specialist. One time I actually saw him stake out a spot in  a milonga, and  continuously exchange <em>ganchos</em>  with his partner for over a minute. Almost half the tango. </p>
    <p>I probably shouldn't do this, but as I worked on the page, I began to recall  filming another <em>Recuerdo</em> dance somewhere. It's from an evening six years ago when Alej and I went early to <em>El Beso</em>.  I had the  camera along, and Osvaldo Buglione was  still arranging tables and setting things up. On a whim, I asked if I could film his dancing. He stopped moving chairs, grabbed Alej, and they went out on the floor. <em>Recuerdo</em> came on, and they danced. Not only was their <em>Recuerdo</em> unrehearsed, but they had never danced together before, so it's a little uneven. Comparing them with a choreographed scene from a movie isn't really fair. It's sort of like demonstrating a Toyota Corolla after a Lexus... but that's okay. A Toyota's a good car, and we're not trying to sell anything here<strong>:</strong> </p>

      <span class="pictureCaption">Osvaldo Buglione and Alej from 2002. </span></div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The term &ldquo;old milonguero&rdquo; has become something of a clich&eacute;, but whenever I hear it, I think of Osvaldo. There&rsquo;s nothing flashy about his dancing, and he&rsquo;s certainly not trying to prove anything. This is just an example of a man who put in thousands of miles in the milongas at a time when tango was unknown outside of the <em>arrabal</em>&mdash;one of the small handful of people who helped to keep tango from dying out completely. I knew him for some time without even realizing he danced. He was Natu&rsquo;s partner in <em>Monton de Tango, </em> the milonga that became so popular in <em>El Beso</em> about 10 years ago. At first, all I ever saw him doing was walking around smoking  cigarettes and running things while Natu played the music.  Then, one time I heard Natu say,  &ldquo;Osvaldo is like  Rip Van Winkle. He and tango went to sleep  for 20 years, and then when tango came back, he woke up!&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The music was difficult,  Osvaldo had been away from tango for twenty years, and Alej isn't  dancing  very well. But  all in all, it&rsquo;s a good example of the kind of efficient posture and movement  that comes from years of dancing  every night in the milongas. It's almost like a man from the past appearing to dance with a member of the current generation. If you try the &quot;lower body block-out&quot; method,  you should see that Alej and Osvaldo's connection to the music is pretty good. And  if you watch  Osvaldo's feet, you can see that he knows the music cold&mdash;he's aware of every note,  every run, and every pause. First time ever dancing together, no warm up, tough music&mdash;but the feeling is there.  The music is inside.   (Note: I think Pugliese wrote this amazing piece of music when he was a teenager! He grew up in <em>Villa Crespo</em>, and I've been by his old house.) (Another good thing about this video is that there's a glimpse of my old  friend Eladia Cordoba looking  hot as she walks by at the beginning.)</p>
