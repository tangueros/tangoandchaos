        <p>So many thanks for you for your site. In Russia navigation problems in milongas are very important. I have translated these chapters into Russian and I wish to place from in Russian sector of the Internet. Certainly I will refer to your site. I hope you will not object.

        <p>This is just to tell you how grateful I am that I can participate in the results of all the research you have been doing. It&rsquo;s been about 4 months ago that a friend of mine told me about your website. Since then I&rsquo;m busy studying and enjoying it <strong>:</strong>-))</p>
        <p> It&rsquo;s a great help to my German analytic mind. Sometimes I notice that my teachers where I take regular classes seem to wonder where I learn all that additional stuff, and  they are quite surprised when suddenly I know the title and the orchestra of a song which they sometimes don&rsquo;t. Also gives me more joy in the Milonga to have developed a closer relationship to the music.</p>

Canberra is the capital city of Australia with around 350,000 residents. The Club puts together a weekly newsletter and I would love to be able to include, with attribution, some of your tips on technique. You explain concepts and technique with rare clarity and our Club members would really benefit from your wisdom. I would be very grateful for your permission to do so.

       I enjoy your site.  I haven't been able to read through it all, but I did like what I saw so far.  I am 30 years old and have been dancing tango for four years. I teach tango here in Buffalo.  I really enjoyed watching some of the milongueros in the videos. I love the complex simplicity in their dancing, and of course the wonderful musicality. It's hard getting dancers to dance that way here&mdash;everyone seems to think bigger is better.   Looking forward to my first trip to BA this summer. Nice work!

       <p>My wife and I are avid readers of your 'Tango and Chaos' series. We enjoy the videos as well as the very intimate and in-depth study of Argentine Tango in what could easily be described as a documentary of tango style. </p>
      Until coming across your web site, we had very little background as to the intricate social aspects of tango as a way of life, and not just as an interesting social dance. It is a way of life unknown to a great many of us, and your introduction is an important link to help bridge a very large gap between what we have learned and what there is to know, understand, and experience. <em>Abrazos</em>,

       <p>I am new to tango, and new to your site, but always an avid and curious student. Almost from the beginning, in spite of the haze and confusion about &lsquo;authenticity&rsquo;, I have pursued insight and meaning in tango. It&rsquo;s an interesting process to say the least.  Your site, found early in my exploration has been such a wonderful contrast, fascinating, encouraging, transmitting all kinds of leads, hints, flavors, moments&mdash;a wonderful collage and homage to the time and place where you and your wife have chosen to be. </p>
       Thank you for making a decision to write and for continuing to decide to write.  Every chapter has been a pleasure. Almost vapor locked with beginner anxiety, living in a place with a very small tango community and utterly lacking a frame of reference to help me situate all this new stuff&mdash;and wrestling with my body, new to dance itself&mdash;I can't express enough, my gratitude for your effort.  If there is more, I hope you keep deciding to write.

I used to rely on Red Bull and vodka  for inspiration, but since Alej read an article in <em>La Nacion</em> about kids half my age drinking it in  rock clubs and ending up in the emergency room with heart failure, she cut me off.

       <p>You got so much in your site, brilliant, all interesting tango-life experience.  And the time you put into it. I was really impressed when I discovered your site the first time. Actually not discovering but exploring it after getting a tip from my dancing partner. It took, as I remember, four evenings just too read it all, which I did within a week between dance lessons and milongas. This was more than a year ago, and from then on I visit your site regularly and I feel that my understanding of the contents grows with the miles (kilometers) I make on the <em>pista</em>. </p>
       <p>The other day in a milonga in my hometown, Groningen in the Netherlands, the DJ put on <em>Gloria,</em> and as soon I heard that voice of Carlos Dante, all things you observed and wrote about this song fell into my mind at once in place! You know, the glorious intention of the text you explained made it such a joy to hear it again. And sitting next to the DJ, I said: what beautiful text. So, the DJ asked if I spoke Spanish. Well he didn't speak it either, so I decided now to print out the part about <em>Gloria</em> to present it to him. I'm sure he'll appreciate it, and you surely won't mind me passing it on to a true <em>aficionado</em>. </p>
       <p>The technical info did improved also my dancing, so I.O.U. &nbsp;<em>&iexcl;Abrazos!</em> </p>

    <p>I was quite stoked to discover that you'd added some new pages to your site recently!   I started to learn to tango two years ago, and in May returned from four months in BA. Now I am re-reading some of your stuff and of course it has new meaning, like anything great will over time. I was thrilled to discover that the old end wasn't the new end! </p>
   I know it's hard to believe that your site could be the first place someone might have ever become aware of songs like <em>Farol</em> and <em>Suerte Loca</em>, but in my case, it's true. I had also procured my tango through recording internet radio station broadcasts, an hour at a time, deleting the breaks and adverts, normalizing the files... ended up with a collection of about 500 tango hours. So I was hearing and dancing to wonderful music, but not learning anything about its provenance. Your site got me on that road. Now I wake up with melodies pounding in my head asking myself, &quot;Oh my god, was I dreaming <em>Al Comp&aacute;s del Corazon</em> or was it <em>Corazon No Le Hagas Caso?</em>&quot;   It may be only the dawn of consciousness, but at least it's not the pitch black of night. I will also be very interested in any further technical ideas you glean from your experience and observation. Cheers and bravo.

              <br /> 
            My wife and I are still dancing in the U.S., but less so.  Despite having ample dancing opportunities, our tango was affected by our trip last August. We were guided by some new friends to Sin Rumbo, where we met the Duplaa brothers. We also had the honor of meeting <em>El Chino</em> and dance at his milonga in Vicente Lopez. The memorable experience marked our tango, indelibly.  I don't believe any one style can corner &quot;truth&quot; in tango, but for us, enjoying these milongas was our tango truth&mdash;a feeling, a way of being that cannot be expressed in words. It felt 'adult' and elegant. Unlike the Dancesport mentality back home, dancing was secondary to the enjoyment of the company.  So coming back to the States with all these nuevo acrobatics and deaf headless chicken runs, leaves us a bit depressed. We have a feeling of homesickness for tango&mdash;or the milonga of adults, ease, and <em>elegancia</em>. Please keep up the wonderful work. What you, Alej, and your friends have created is truly a beacon for tango.    </p>

      ps: I can't stop watching this<a href="chapt_5video/24chino.htm"> video of <em>El chino</em></a>. Its salon aesthetic represents for us the real beauty of Tango.

    Thanks for the new work on your web site. I had read it before back at the start of 2007 before I went to BsAs for April, May &amp; June. I returned to your site because I Googled Ricardo Vidort and found the new material. I am so pleased to have more video of him to watch and to learn more about him as a person. One day at <em>Estilo</em> milonga I saw a man dancing and loved his minimalist style. When I told him so, he said that his teacher was present. So I met <a href="chapt_3search/17women.htm" target="_top">Myriam Pincen</a> and took group classes from her at Salon Canning. Through her I was introduced to the legacy of Maestro Vidort and then started watching the videos of him on YouTube. My tango has evolved in a whole new wonderful direction from there. I'm back in Port Townsend, USA, now and spreading the good word personally and through my blog at RealityPivots.  (I also love your reference to Carlos Castaneda sitting in the bus station in Tucson. His books had a huge influence on me and it is great to see him mentioned.) </p>

   I must say that I have developed a certain addiction to your site&mdash;finding a new or enhanced chapter makes my day. I was specially delighted to see the Vidort chapter. While I believe that everyone should develop his or her own style, the only one whose style I would adopt in a heart beat is Vidort. For me, this is not the Vidort style; it is the essence of Tango. &nbsp;

     He built a house/dance where I can live. Not an impossible construction/choreography for young professional full time dancers.  Maybe his dance was not very attractive for the non-dancing public, but I'm quite sure that he was greatly admired by the real milongueros. His musicality, simplicity and harmony were unique. </p>
