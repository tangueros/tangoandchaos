    &quot;In the milonga everybody sees everything&quot; </font></em></font></p>
  
    <p >When you  walk into a milonga in Buenos Aires  for the first time it might not look like anything special. You&rsquo;ll see some  couples dancing tango, and maybe some other people sitting around at  tables.&nbsp; The only unusual thing an  outsider may notice is that the men and women are sitting apart when they  aren&rsquo;t dancing&mdash; often facing each other on different sides of the room.&nbsp; And if there are couples, they are usually  sitting in a different area.&nbsp; But of  course there is a lot more going on than meets the eye.&nbsp; A very complex social ritual is taking place  that has been refined for almost 100 years.&nbsp;  The people are following a set of rules called &ldquo;<em>codigos&rdquo;.</em>&nbsp; They aren&rsquo;t  written down, but the milongueros and milongueras who have been around for a  long time know them&mdash; and they follow them.&nbsp;  Violate them at your peril.</p>
  <p >The  purpose of the <em>codigos</em> is to allow  things to run smoothly.&nbsp; A crowded  milonga is a highly charged environment.&nbsp;  Milongueros and milongueras are proud people, and tango is a very  passionate thing.&nbsp; There is always some  romantic tension between the men and women, and also, of course, a bit of  competitiveness between the dancers as well.&nbsp;  Pack two or three hundred people in a room together, and the need for a  set of rules to minimize conflict becomes obvious.&nbsp; </p>
  <p >This was  the world that I wandered into five years ago&mdash;and I have been addicted to it  ever since.&nbsp; It was a lot of fun to write  about, although in the beginning I was incredibly green, and I made the classic  beginners mistakes.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ve learned a  lot since that first night in <em>El Beso</em>, when I blatantly violated one of the  most well known codes of tango by walking over to a table of Argentine women I  didn&rsquo;t know, and asking one of them to dance.&nbsp;  (I was with my friend Malik at the time, and I can still hear him  laughing and saying, &ldquo;Denied! Denied!&rdquo;&mdash;a basketball term for a player who has  the ball is slammed right back at him after taking a stupid shot).&nbsp; Since that inauspicious debut, I&rsquo;ve learned a  lot.&nbsp; I know there are codes that cover  almost everything that happens in a milonga, and although I don&rsquo;t know them  all, I would like to discuss a few things that should help a newcomer to the  BsAs milongas make it through the first few years without too much  embarrassment. </p>
  <p  class="paragraphHeader">Tip #1&mdash;Everybody Sees Everything.</p>
  <p >In Buenos Aires they say  that, &ldquo;In the milonga, everyone sees everything&rdquo;.&nbsp; It means that from the  moment you walk in the door, to the time you leave, you will be watched.&nbsp;  Your clothing, your walk, your posture, where you sit&mdash;all will be  scrutinized.&nbsp; I learned this the hard way.&nbsp; Several years ago we were  in a place called <em>Afiche.</em>&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t exist today, but at the time <em>El  Pibe</em> Sarandi had a milonga there.&nbsp; It was only a small restaurant with  a tiny dance floor, but because <em>El Pibe</em> is a serious milonguero, many of  the important dancers in BsAs squeezed inside to eat and dance.&nbsp; One night  Alejandra and I were there with a woman from the U.S.&nbsp; We were tired and, and  all we wanted to do was eat something and listen to a friend who was there  singing tango&mdash;but the woman had come all the way from the U.S., and she  really wanted to dance.&nbsp; She was not very experienced, and I had no desire  to dance with her&mdash; but it was clear that the milongueros weren&rsquo;t going to ask  her, and it looked like she was going to sit all night.&nbsp; So, finally I  decided to be a nice guy and I asked her to dance.&nbsp; It was the last song  of a tanda, and the small floor was packed.&nbsp; We sort of squeezed into the  middle, and I shuffled through a tango&mdash; but my heart wasn&rsquo;t in it.&nbsp; Then  we sat back down, and I felt pretty good about having done my duty.&nbsp; A few  minutes later, a milonguero came over and asked me to step outside.&nbsp; I had  no idea what he wanted, but I followed him out. We stood on the sidewalk for a  minute, and then he said, &ldquo;I saw you dancing.&rdquo;&nbsp; I thought maybe he was  going to say what a nice guy I was for dancing with the tourist&hellip; but no.  Instead, he said this: &ldquo;You can do better than that.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t come here  in front of these people and dance like that.&nbsp; When you dance tango you  must give everything. Wait for the right music, and then give EVERYTHING!&rdquo;  He kind of tapped me on the chest as he said it.&nbsp; Then he said, &ldquo;If you  can't do that, do not dance.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he went back inside.</p>
  <p ><img src="3_pics/title_page1.jpg" alt="Asador at Pippo's, downtown BsAs" width="338" height="288" class="floatLeft"/>I stood  there, and I could actually feel my face burning.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what I  expected&mdash; but to be told by one of the best milongueros in Buenos Aires that I  should either get it together, or go home, really stung.&nbsp; After a bit I  went back in and sat down, but I didn&rsquo;t say anything to Alej.&nbsp; Later the  next day I finally told Alej what happened.&nbsp; She thought for a minute, and  said, &ldquo;Well, XXXX was right.&nbsp; These guys are watching everything you  do.&nbsp; The floor may have been crowded, and you may have been in the middle,  but they saw it all.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she said, &ldquo;These milongueros don&rsquo;t dance all  the time.&nbsp; They wait, and they only dance when they feel the music.&nbsp;  And they never dance with someone they don&rsquo;t want to dance with.&nbsp; But when  they do dance&hellip; they put all the meat on the fire!&nbsp; And they won&rsquo;t respect  you if you don&rsquo;t do it also.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p >Wow.&nbsp;  &ldquo;<em>Todo la carne en la Parrilla!</em>&rdquo;&nbsp; All the meat on the fire.&nbsp;  What an Argentine way of putting it.&nbsp; I thought about a friend of mine who  told me about his great leap forward in skiing.&nbsp; He said he was slogging  along one day, and suddenly he got mad at himself.&nbsp; So he skied down to  the lodge at Squaw Valley, took off his skis, went into the restroom, looked in  the mirror, and said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re either going to go hard every minute you&rsquo;re on  the mountain, or your going to go home and put your skis away for good.&rdquo;&nbsp;  And after that, he became a great skier.&nbsp; (Well, he was already a great  professional skier, but he got a lot better).&nbsp; So, I looked in the mirror and did the  same thing.&nbsp; I decided to film all the milongueros, so I could really  learn tango.&nbsp; And I began to prepare for the milongas like a sports  competition.&nbsp; I would spin on the bike to loosen up, and take time to  stretch and warm up before going out.&nbsp; I began to dress up, with polished  shoes, neat hair, and often, a coat and tie.&nbsp; And the milongueros noticed&mdash;  because the saying is true.&nbsp; In the milongas, they really do see everything. </p>
  <p>In the  end, those words on the sidewalk that seemed so harsh at the time turned out to  be the best single piece of tango advice I ever received.&nbsp; In fact, they  sort of became my motto.&nbsp; When I first put up this web site, I used them  as a subheading, under the &ldquo;Tango and Chaos&rdquo; title.&nbsp; And they are still  there today.</p>
  <p align="center" class="paragraphHeader">Tip #2&mdash;Don&rsquo;t Show Off</p>
  <p >One of  the most insulting things that can be said about a person in the milonga is that  they want to &ldquo;<em>llamar la atenci&oacute;n</em>&rdquo;&hellip;they want to &ldquo;call the attention&rdquo;.  Even the very best milongueros display a low-key, respectful attitude in the milongas.&nbsp; Good dancing is admired and appreciated, but a  milonga isn&rsquo;t a place to show off.&nbsp; Talking loudly, jumping around on the  dance floor, or even walking around in a conspicuous way will be noticed.&nbsp;  Unfortunately, foreigners have a reputation for doing this.&nbsp; The regular  dancers are complaining more and more about bad behavior by the tourists who  have been flooding the milongas over the past year.&nbsp; Sometimes it&rsquo;s easy  for someone who is a superstar in his own city to think he or she is really  making a big impression in BsAs, especially when the older people dancing  around him seem so low key.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s best to remember that people are moving  in an understated way, at least in comparison to many milongas outside of Argentina, and that they are dancing tango in  subtle ways that most foreigners can&rsquo;t begin to see without many years of  experience in Buenos Aires. </p>
  <p align="center"><img src="3_pics/titl_page2.jpg" alt="The milongueros watch everything." width="273" height="282" class="floatRight"/></p>
  <p >At this  point, we may have painted a somewhat bleak picture&mdash;a room lined with serious  looking men and women passing judgment on everything and everyone about a dance  that only they can do, and a set of rules that only they understand.&nbsp; And  that is a reality of tango.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s only one reality&mdash;only one of many  complex parts.&nbsp; Another reality is that tango is lots and lots of  fun.&nbsp; If it weren&rsquo;t, thousands of people every night wouldn&rsquo;t be packing  into the milongas to enjoy it.&nbsp; Earlier I said, somewhat ominously, that  you violate the <em>codigos</em> &ldquo;at your own peril.&rdquo;&nbsp; This should be  explained.&nbsp; What does happen if you break the rules?&nbsp; Well, it  depends.&nbsp; But basically&hellip; nothing happens.&nbsp; </p>
  <p >One of the  real keys to understanding what&rsquo;s going on in tango is language, and foreigners  are at a tremendous disadvantage.&nbsp; Not only is it hard to understand what  people are saying in a milonga, it is also virtually impossible to understand  the lyrics of the music&mdash;and these lyrics are tremendously important.&nbsp; (We  plan to discuss them in future pages, but for now, let&rsquo;s leave it at this:  probably the most important thing a tango dancer can do to improve his or her  dancing is to learn the lyrics of the songs.)&nbsp; Language is a small window  into the way people think, and time and again as I pick up more <em>castellano</em>,  I am reminded of this.&nbsp; The phrase above is an example:&nbsp; when the  people use <em>&ldquo;llamar la atenci&oacute;n&rdquo;</em> they are saying something very specific.&nbsp;  They aren&rsquo;t talking about psychological motivation, the way we might use &ldquo;show  off&rdquo; or &ldquo;ego&rdquo; or &ldquo;insecure&rdquo;.&nbsp; They aren&rsquo;t making a value judgment about  that person&rsquo;s character.&nbsp; They are simply saying that the person doesn&rsquo;t  understand tango, and their place in the milonga.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a small violation  with a small penalty.&nbsp; </p>
  <p >So,  again, what are the penalties?&nbsp; At the worst level, a person might be  asked to leave.&nbsp; Or they may find they are bumped and blocked when they  try to dance.&nbsp; But these things are very rare.&nbsp; There is a phrase you  hear time and again: <em>&ldquo;El no existe.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp; It means that person does not  exist&mdash;it refers to a man (or woman) who isn&rsquo;t there.&nbsp; And, depending on who you are,  this can be a blessing or a curse.&nbsp; For beginners and foreign tourists  it&rsquo;s a blessing.&nbsp; It means you are invisible, and can do pretty much what  you want.&nbsp; The milongueras and milongueros will be polite, and even  friendly, but you don&rsquo;t exist inside their world of codes and dancing.&nbsp;  For a regular in the milongas it can be a bit worse.&nbsp; It means that you don&rsquo;t  exist in terms of the <em>cabeceo</em>.&nbsp; That is, the chair you are sitting  in becomes empty, and a man or woman looking for a dance simply doesn&rsquo;t see  you.&nbsp; Finally, worst of all, it can mean that a person is unwelcome.&nbsp;  They don&rsquo;t exist socially.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t exist in the <em>cabeceo</em>, they  aren&rsquo;t welcome at other peoples tables, and they are never invited  anywhere.&nbsp; This is very serious if it happens to someone who regularly  goes to milongas.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s rare, but it  happens.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

  <p class="pictureCaption">Nice stage tango... but pausing and posing like this would block traffic<br /> 
    in a milonga, and take up too much floor space.    </p>
  </div>
  <p>You can&rsquo;t  hide in a milonga, but a good person and a good dancer will succeed.&nbsp; Good  dancing is made up of many things.&nbsp; Speaking only from a technical  perspective, the three most important are: to be &ldquo;<em>bien parado</em>&rdquo; (to be  &ldquo;well standing&rdquo;&hellip; that is to maintain good balanced posture), to &ldquo;<em>pisar bien</em>&rdquo;  (to step well), and to be &ldquo;<em>en el comp&aacute;s</em>&rdquo; (to dance within the  cadence).&nbsp; But there is a fourth element, called floor navigation, that isn&rsquo;t as  well understood. Floor navigation is the ability to move smoothly to the  music around the crowded floor without bothering other dancers.&nbsp; The floor  of a milonga is like a flowing freeway&mdash;and dancers should never do things that  don&rsquo;t belong there.&nbsp; The worst violation, of course, is to throw the legs  around and take up a lot of room.&nbsp; The second big mistake is to stop to do  a bunch of adornments or stage moves.&nbsp; Both things disrupt the flow on the  floor, and they are appreciated about as much as a truck on the freeway that  keeps speeding up and slowing down, and dropping obstacles onto the road.&nbsp;  The tools needed to navigate well are tied closely to the basic techniques of  good social tango.&nbsp; In short, this means that if you dance tango the right  way, you will naturally navigate well, and if you navigate well, you will  naturally dance well.&nbsp; The elements of high-level tango are the same  skills needed for high-level floor navigation.&nbsp; Here they are:    </p>
  
  <p>1.&nbsp;  The ability to do smooth tight <em>giros</em> (turns) in both directions, at any  time during the dance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This allows a trapped dancer to  instantly dance on a dime until space opens up.&nbsp; And if you are &ldquo;<em>bien  parado</em>&rdquo;, your head will be up while you turn, so you can constantly survey  the area around you, and look for space to open  up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>2. The  ability to step smoothly and quickly in any direction.&nbsp; This means being  able to instantly take a step of any length in any direction, and to bring your  partner along with you.&nbsp; A leader should be able to turn, look, and then  slip to the front, back, or side quickly and smoothly when there is  space.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>3. The  ability to step on the weak beat, and lead your partner along as well.&nbsp;  This is part of musical expression, but quick steps are also a big part of  navigation.&nbsp; They allow a dancer to fine tune speed and direction to steer  around the floor, and to avoid bothering other dancers.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>A group  of dancers practicing these skills will be able to use the available floor  space with maximum efficiency, and minimum interference with each others  dancing.&nbsp; </p>

  <p align="center" class="pictureCaption">The best milongueros don&rsquo;t need much room to dance&mdash;here are 14 couples dancing in a space<br /> 
  slightly larger than an automobile. </p>
  <br />

  <p align="center" class="figure25">At an advanced level, navigation is more than a survival skill.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s an essential part of the art of tango.&nbsp;The path and manner that a leader moves around the floor are an advanced way of expressing the music, and  navigation actually becomes a part of artistic expression.&nbsp;Very good couples dancing close to each other are expressing the music together by the way they flow around each other.&nbsp;This is a big reason why good milongueros seek out each other&rsquo;s company.&nbsp;Just like dancing with a good partner, dancing close to other couples who really know tango is a better experience.&nbsp;And it is why we try, whenever possible, to film dancers in a milonga dancing next to other good dancers.&nbsp;It is a completely different thing than dancing on a stage or in a studio.&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center" class="figure25">In the pictures above, about 30 people are dancing together comfortably in a small one car garage.&nbsp;They represent a cross section of some of the best dancers in town, and it&rsquo;s obvious from the casual clothing and the facial expressions (and of course the unusual location) that this is not an ordinary milonga.&nbsp;These are pictures of an important part of Buenos Aires tango that has been around for many years&hellip; but it is almost unknown to outsiders.&nbsp;We&rsquo;ll discuss it later.</p>
