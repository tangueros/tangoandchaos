      <p>Here&rsquo;s one last set of <em>Fino</em> and Maria Teresa.&nbsp;Despite their poor quality of the images, I think the precision and beauty of the way they move comes through.&nbsp;As they move around the floor of the milonga, they display the essence of good tango: they are <em>bien parado</em> (standing well), they <em>pisan bien </em>(step well) and they are <em>en el comp&aacute;s</em> (in the cadence of the music).&nbsp;Everyone learns differently, but a dancer who can absorb these images, and build a mental picture of Fino (or of Maria) will dance well.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The final picture (above) shows one of the most difficult positions for any couple&mdash;the first step of a right <em>giro</em>.&nbsp;<em>Fino</em> is stepping between Maria Teresa&rsquo;s legs (a <em>sacada</em>), and starting the big pivot around to the right.&nbsp;Note that neither of them sacrifices their posture or their connection as they begin the turn.&nbsp;<em>Fino&rsquo;s</em> contemporaries are great dancers, but I don&rsquo;t see any of them showing this degree of precision in their posture or their steps.&nbsp;This seems to be a characteristic that appeared later among the milongueros, and there are several dozen who dance like this today.</p>
      <p>Where did <em>Fino</em> and Maria find such precise discipline and technique?&nbsp;It's very hard to say, but I really don't think it existed in tango before they appeared. It is known that behind any successful athlete is a combination of genetics, opportunity, and motivation&hellip; and for <em>Fino</em>, it obviously all came together.&nbsp;He was born and raised in the <em>arrabal</em>, with tango in his blood, and he was certainly motivated and very talented.&nbsp;But there is something else.&nbsp;When <em>Fino</em> was about to die, he told Miguel Zotto that he had taken ballet classes when he was young.&nbsp;This is not something a milonguero would like to admit&mdash; but apparently it&rsquo;s true.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not uncommon for the classical dance training at <em>Teatro Colon</em> to turn out men and women who move into stage tango and find success.&nbsp;But men trained in ballet lack the &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; step of the milongueros and the passion for the music, so respect in the milongas is hard to find.&nbsp;In fact I don&rsquo;t know of one of them who has been successful.&nbsp;From the<em> f&uacute;tbol canchas</em> to the floor of the milonga, yes.&nbsp;From classical dance training, never.&nbsp;But tango is full of contradictions.&nbsp;Could it be that the one added element needed to create the perfect milonguero was a bit of the discipline and balance picked up from some ballet classes?&nbsp;How ironic if ballet added the final element needed to create the modern style of today&rsquo;s best milongueros.&nbsp;</p>
