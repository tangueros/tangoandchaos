      <p>We always like to film social tango dancing more than performances.&nbsp;But surprisingly, several of the most moving tango videos we have ever taken were of couples performing.&nbsp;One is of Javier and his little sister Malena dancing at Sunderland on her 12th birthday.&nbsp;Javier and his partner Geraldine were probably the best couple performing tango in the world over the past few years (Javier and Geraldine are both in the <em>Assassination Tango</em> movie&mdash;but not dancing together).&nbsp;Although both dance on the stage, they are children of the milongas (there is film of Geraldine as a child dancing with Portalea, and Javier&rsquo;s dad is a milonguero in <em>Villa Urquiza</em>).&nbsp;In our video, you can feel the connection between Javier and his little sister (we made a copy of the tape and gave it to her later), but the faces of the crowd in the background are what makes the video special.&nbsp;The milongueros and milongueras in Sunderland are, to use a trite expression, glowing.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s as if they are watching their own children, and the atmosphere is charged with energy and good feeling.</p>

      <p>While Malena is one of the youngest dancers we&rsquo;ve filmed, another great performance we have on video is of one of the oldest couples, Carlitos y Porota.&nbsp;On a cold night in May last year we went to a milonga at <em>Glorias Argentinas</em> to celebrate the <em>Cumplea&ntilde;os de la Patria</em> (Argentina&rsquo;s birthday).&nbsp;The place was filled with long time tango dancers from all over the city, including lots of known performers.&nbsp;It was the largest crowd we&rsquo;ve ever seen there, and like Malena&rsquo;s night at Sunderland, there was a strong feeling of family&hellip; from the beginning when we stood together to sing the <em>Himno Nacional Argentino</em>, to the end when Carlitos and Porota danced for the crowd.&nbsp;(Okay, I admit I just hummed along with the national anthem because I didn&rsquo;t know the words.)&nbsp;I think Carlitos is the uncle of Facundo (the well known black milonguero).&nbsp;While there are a lot of similarities to <em>Petroleo&rsquo;s</em> dancing (quick side stepping, toe walking, and the more side-to-side connection of the partners), there are some different things like slow leg raises and other figures that I can&rsquo;t even categorize.&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t want to over analyze it&hellip; let&rsquo;s just look at some of  the pictures:&nbsp;</p>

      <span class="pictureCaption">But they also do things I&rsquo;ve never seen before like kicks and hopping on one leg.<br />
      &nbsp; Could this be a window back into the African roots of tango and <em>conbombe</em>?</span><br />

<p>Carlitos and Porota&rsquo;s dancing is certainly rooted in the oldest styles of the <em>Mataderos</em> barrio&mdash;and the people say that&rsquo;s where tango began.&nbsp;He does unusual kicks and knee raises, and sometimes he uses the quick toe sidestepping of <em>Petroleo</em> (although he and Porota do it slower because of their age).&nbsp;And although Porota stays to Carlitos right much of the time, they move forward so slowly that Carlitos doesn&rsquo;t run past his partner the way <em>Petroleo</em> often does.&nbsp;Is it possible that we are seeing some hints of the black roots of tango in his dancing as well?&nbsp;It&rsquo;s only speculation, but his dancing is different than anything Alej and I have ever seen (and we have seen and filmed a lot in the clubs).&nbsp;Ironically, as we watched this couple dancing in the oldest of ways, I felt that we were seeing something very new as well.&nbsp;At Malena&rsquo;s performance the people sat quietly, beaming like proud parents, and then erupted in applause at the finish.&nbsp;But this crowd was different.&nbsp;From the moment Carlitos and Porota walked on the floor, people went crazy.&nbsp;And as Carlitos danced, he tried wilder and wilder things.&nbsp;He was improvising in every way possible to the old time <em>Orquesta Victor</em> music, and the crowd, cheered, laughed, teased, and yelled comments the entire time.&nbsp;And this was no ordinary crowd.&nbsp;The three or four hundred people at <em>Glorias Argentinas</em> that night included many of best milongueros and performers in BsAs, and the combined tango experience and knowledge in the room was staggering.&nbsp;There is always speculation about the way tango changes and develops, and I think we were witnessing one of those ways.&nbsp;The crowd spurred Carlitos on to try more and more new things, and if it worked they went crazy.&nbsp;If not, he tried something else.&nbsp;This is certainly one way tango evolved&mdash;with the most knowledgeable dancers judging a popular and respected couple in places just like this.&nbsp;Cheering them on and encouraging new things, rejecting what they didn&rsquo;t like, and copying what they did.</p>
<p> Normally we aren&rsquo;t big tango performance fans, and we don&rsquo;t perform ourselves.&nbsp;I want to be like the great <em>Milonguita</em>. He refused to perform because he said it would damage his tango soul.&nbsp;Actually, I have performed tango twice in Argentina.&nbsp;Once it was at the wedding of Alejandra&rsquo;s son (no way I could get out of that one).&nbsp;The other time was strange.&nbsp;We were actually tricked into performing a <em>vals</em> in front of a large crowd.&nbsp;And it happened in the same place these pictures were taken&mdash;<em>Glorias Argentinas</em>.&nbsp;But I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m ready to tell that story right now.&nbsp;Over a drink maybe, but not here.&nbsp;      <br />
