  Quick Feet </p>
  <p>Tango and also soccer are a little like basketball in some of the inner city neighborhoods in the U.S., because there was a time when they were almost the only forms of recreation available to many young men. And in the working class barrios of Buenos Aires, there is still a strong connection between soccer and tango.&nbsp;The streets and vacant lots of BsAs are full of kids kicking soccer balls around, and there are large <em>f&uacute;tbol</em> stadiums everywhere in the city.&nbsp;A friend who is with the San Lorenzo F&uacute;tbol Club told me that Buenos Aires has an incredible 18 professional teams, which is about equal to all of the <em>f&uacute;tbol</em> teams in most European countries.&nbsp;So it&rsquo;s natural that the quick feet and natural balance of many great tango dancers were developed on the <em>canchas de f&uacute;tbol</em> in the BsAs neighborhoods.<font color="#000000"><em>&nbsp;</em></font>

    <p class="pictureCaption"><em>Pibes</em> from the neighborhood play f&uacute;tbol in the shadow of Boca Stadium.&nbsp;Some kids on yellow and blue painted bikes came up and ask Alejandra why I was taking these pictures. She said it was because I was a big Boca fan&mdash;but that I also liked San Lorenzo (our friend is Vice President of the club and we get free stuff from the team).&nbsp;The kids said, that's okay, but San Lorenzo is in a <em>villa miseria</em> (a dangerous slum), and they would never go there (of course Boca itself has a reputation as being one of the rougher barrios in the city).&nbsp;I have a great San Lorenzo jersey, but Alej doesn&rsquo;t want me wearing it around BsAs.&nbsp;She says someone might throw a rock at me if I wander into the wrong part of town.</p>

    <p>Good soccer players keep their feet close to the ground when running through traffic.&nbsp;This gives them better stability, and it also allows them to change direction quickly.&nbsp;Stability and maneuverability are essential tools for success on crowded canchas de f&uacute;tbol and, on also the floors of crowded tango clubs as well.&nbsp;Many athletes practice agility drills where they mix small quick steps with large steps and direction changes to develop foot speed and balance.&nbsp;And this is something that milongueros are familiar with as well.&nbsp;Quick stepping cadences are, of course, a central part of the art of tango.&nbsp;Good dancers use them creatively with the cadences of the music&mdash;
	but when the floor is crowded, they also serve the same purpose as in tennis or basketball.&nbsp;They allow couples to change direction quickly to avoid other dancers.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>But the need to maneuver and survive in crowded conditions has affected tango in even more fundamental ways. We&rsquo;ll look at that on the next page. </p>
